# 100 Books I Adore

[Following Darius Foroux's lead](https://medium.com/life-learning/100-great-books-to-read-in-a-lifetime-f3b7069ce8b3), I'm now inspired to share some of the books that have formed my mind over the years. My list may weigh more towards fiction, and it may weigh in at less than 100 tomes.

Rather than attempt to alphabetize them from my phone, or rank them—a feat I'll shy from just as Darius did—I'll lay them down stream of consciousness.
