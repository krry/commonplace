# Covision

Seeing together

When this began, it was a [Coronation](https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/the-coronation/). I haven't yet fully gleaned this shift.

It's time to focus our covision. Can we see both sides of a contradiction at once? Can we deign to admit that this way and that way are both valid? Can we drop the mask and still feel safe? Can we present ourself to the world with compassionate humility?

Covision is the summit to which we are ambling. As we collaborate and conspire so readily in our remote lockdowns
