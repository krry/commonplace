# Journal Entry, Monday, March 08, 2021

Today I have implemented the Tiago's [[para-method]] system. My old structure had Concepts, Projects, Formats, Topics and the distinctions are so muddy between these boxes.

We now also have a new note snippet called 'zettel' that gives us FrontMatter and a title and such.

I'll also add front matter to my journal entries now
Or will I?
Might have to ask the Foam folks about that.
Turns out it's on the roadmap but not released yet.

Notably backlinks will be handled in Foam now and seem to be working today.

[//begin]: # 'Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility'
[para-method]: ../../intend/para-method 'PARA method'
[//end]: # 'Autogenerated link references'
