- Attempting to archive or in some way process the last few years of notebooks, I returned to Roam which smacked of the system I have been craving as I created these notebooks.
- I aspire to inputting all of my resonant poems, notions, theories, postulates, hypotheses, ruminations, ponderings, and wonderings from these notebooks, along with many that were recorded digitally, then making this graph available to other Roamers as it becomes coherent and potentially valuable.
- **A few ground rules** might be helpful as I start, though I know protocol will evolve as the graph does:
    - ### [[Citation]]
    - ### [[Chronology]]
    - ### [[Petition]]
- And then I have begun importing the Get Real handwritten manuscript/monograph here as Roam graph. It all starts with [[üåç The Game]].
