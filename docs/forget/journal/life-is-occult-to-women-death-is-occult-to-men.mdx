# life is occult to women, death is occult to men

As I attempt to highlight from many angles in this dusty [[convergence-of-study---modern-replacements]], many of the trends of cultural progress, the trajectories of "civilization," share a few characteristics:

- [[androcracy]] - they are run/lead/controlled by men
- [[mortality]] - they are focused on life as limited
- [[lethargy]] - they make us stiller, more docile

Which reminds me, have you looked at [the etymology of "vaccinate"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/vaccination)? [[2021-03-25-vaccinated]] How about ["inoculate"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/inoculate)?

There's a comic strip in here somewhere, where Thomas Aquinas gets Bill'n'Ted'd to today, and someone suggests that he get vaccinated, or inoculated with a vaccine, and he hears "Lemme put this in your eye so you can be like a cow."

I know, I know. Don't quit your day job. Joke's on you. I don't have a day job.
