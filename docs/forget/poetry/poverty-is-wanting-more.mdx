title: Poverty Is Wanting More
---
# Poverty Is Wanting MoreI sometimes wish
it didn't take a lifetime to
tell the stories we need.

They really do drag in the middle
bits when the heroin has lost
her fleece.

Up till now
she's been all capers and lox.
A swell cookie,
a ginger snap.

Poverty is wanting more
not having less.
Depravity is clutching tightly
a fistful of nothingness.
