# It Tears Me Up
by Cecelia

## This too shall pass

We're gritting through the brunt here
I feel your clench, my tears are hot
Let's get to the crest
Let's slide down there

## sex tears

Were there
Weve been there
Were glad youre here
Your healing inslide

## why does my tears come

my grok doesnt
my cock doesnt
nothing else comes

why does my tears come

why does my grok

why does your cock

my grok can tear you
my cock can
why tear your grok

come tear my grok

## why does my tears (v2)

my grok does
my cock does
nothing else comes

my grok can tear you
my cock can

why tear your grok
come tear my grok

nothing else can

## I'm methaneable

A serious thing occurred to me today in a dream.
I will never be murdered.
It would take a Brutal conspiracy to kill me,
and I'm nothing near to Caesar.

Easily me, the thane
lord of sky's rim for a year
of unemployment

Since when do people read

## Work through the tears

Why am I crying?
Mostly gas
Prior gas
Fuck you.

## Sofa king

I wanna open a restaurant.
It'll serve pizza
-flavored foods that don't look like pizza.
The couches will couchez avec moi.
You can be king if you slice me.

## the new hai-ku

this rhythm is spent
our thoughts rail and spring against
what once has expressed

## Backlash from a question
"When can you go home?"
I can't.
You can't either.
No sense in 'why's.
The sense is present.
The future is nigh.

Sometimes memes get in you.

## But when can you go home?
## But when can you go home?
## But when can you go home?
## But when can you go home?
## But when can you go home?

I fucking can't!

I can't.

Where is home?
Why does it matter?

Am I bombastic? Am I hysterical? Yes.
Am I quiet about it? Yes.
Am I a new gender paradigm? No.
I'm a human fucking. A being.
Are you? Are you being, are you fucking, are you?

Am I channelling someone?
What's my damage?
Wait, what was your questionâ€”who the eff are you?!

## Vaginal tears
