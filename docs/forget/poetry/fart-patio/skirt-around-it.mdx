# Skirt Around It

I wasn't born with hang-ups
or a gender in mind.
They gave me a girl's name
in the knives for eyes
of father sky.

I saw Dorothy
dream up a better way
to save the world than Jesus
Kansas Fucking Christ
while the Wizard soiled his whites.

Dottie flew
which way
the wind blew
songs to cure the
sin we threw
into our babies (our babies into).

Clothes are fretful
bondage to a child
untamed by shame,
and boundaries
are ludicrous
to one who
feels the same
as everyone
and everything

entwined
in a dance
of who's to blame,
I bow out and
beat my feet
to these fateful 
faultless lines
beyond the palest
moonlit mind.

So I found a bandana
and learned a knot
to tie a skirt around
my 3 y.o. behind

I'm as queer as they say
but as normal as you
