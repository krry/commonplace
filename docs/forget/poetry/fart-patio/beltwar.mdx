# Eclipsing Binaries

You belt the war I feign to fight.
You yelled the score; I felt almighty.
You fell to fours. I sighed, ignited.
You grasp the prey. I'll hunt for more.

You climb the cliff, I be laying for you.
You work a sweat up, I drink your cider.
You talk a big game, I play a long one.
You mount horny beasts to walls.
I track and fill and coat them.

When time fails to tick
and space gives no pause
we'll topple toward bliss,
insight effects cause.
