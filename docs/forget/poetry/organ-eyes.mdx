# Organ Eyes

We'll not meat in the dust this year
the fear throttles us as we rise to wake
ships hover well above the horizon
floating thru santa Barbara's channel
on subsidies, on desperate claws sunk into the world's willing carcass
from here uphill, where the rising seas can't touch us (isn't that white Jimboy)
from this vantage perched above the crows, a vulture stoop
beyond the pale tall palm spread welcoming a zodiac of crows
into my/our borrowed yardsky
from here the container ships hover as though tethered to a zillion Bezoscopters
as though billowing upon a furrowing effulgence of naivete
sorry, evianete, pardon my francais
somebody ought to bottle my ignorance, the royal ours.

And the palms, they plop foliage in the pacified sea
from here
they won't let us in the apartment downstairs
although we share a hot tub waterfall infinity pool downhill swimming situation

It's been too long since I wrote a poem, hence the uncomfortable feeling I am releasing and you are absorbing.
