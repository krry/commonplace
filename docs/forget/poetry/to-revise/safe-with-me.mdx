# Safe With Me

I woke up today at 11ish.
And went back to bed.
The dog came down to my parents' basement
to check on me
I'm 36 years old
I have no money
No job
No house, no car, et cetera
No lover
Some great friends
I don't talk to them
Too embarrassed about the rest

I've been hiding.
Rang in the New Year alone.
2019
One more year until...
Well, I don't know about you
But I keep thinking 2020
is gonna be the Singularity.

We'll get to that…

So once I rolled off of the inflatable mattress
at 2:30 p.m., January 3rd, 2019
I thought to myself,
"Something's gotta change.
I can't keep staying up late
and sleeping in late
and not having a job
and living here
languishing
minimizing my needs
eliminating my wants
nothing out of life
nothing for myself."
What happened to me?
Where are my dreams?

I went on the endangered individuals list back in 2001.
I haven't loved myself since then, if I ever did.
I haven't felt safe with myself.
I haven't been safe.

Am I the puppet or the puppeteer?

If I'm the puppet,
and the puppeteer is inside me,
then I don't trust him.
He doesn't seem to like me.
He gets me drunk a lot.
Any money ends up gone.
I'm a smoker. What the fuck?!
Now I vape… constantly.
It's embarrassing.
At least it doesn't stink
up the couches I'm surfing.

Whoever's in charge must not like me?

If I'm the puppeteer
then what the fuck does it matter?
This isn't me.
This ain't real.
There's nothing to lose and nothing to win.
Eventually I'll drop the controls
and get back to whatever else is.
It's not like I asked for this,
to be here.
So just leave me be.
Give me my hand back.
Maybe whoever put me here can refund you,
if you give a shit.

I was hopeless.
The birthday balloon from a month ago
just enough helium to keep it off the carpet.
The rattly sigh when you've just finished
today's bottle of vodka
your saliva sputtering
in the sigh of relief
as you totter at the toilet
pissing away said vodka.

Today I jumped perspectives.
I set the intention to love myself.
Then I ✌️d the last tab of the Swoon acid.

And the puppet and puppeteer became one. And I gave myself, my new whole self a hug. "You're safe here, with me. I'll take care of you." And I cried as I jogged along and I felt safe with myself for the first time I can remember.

"Why pick up the controller?"
