# A Brief History of Life as It Was and Is

It seems perfectly well explained until you ask it this way, doesn't it? Let's play the causality game, start at the beginning.

Already this
third barren,
molten stone
from the star had spewed enough
geothermal flatulence
to cloud the skies
and bring the rains.

Life sprang up
when amino acids swam 
together in a tide pool
and found homeostasis
in a filmy dome.

In spite of
ever-changing conditions
and epochal catastrophes,
these code-holding membranes persist.

Tectonic genocide
slays all but the A+ prokaryotes.
One survivor,
in a profane act of ***cellatio***,
swallows another
without digesting it.

The cellated ones
find shelter within
and design a means
of synergetic exchange,
transitioning to mitochondria.

As the rains clear the skies,
some amoeba get their chlorophyll
of the falling minerals
that had spewed forth
from the crust
and blotted out the sun.

Algae to seaweed.
Paramecium to giant squid.
Fish to frog to leopard.
Life adapts as nature selects
the resilient oddities to keep.
Pangaea divides
and birds soar
to reunite their families
and the continents.

Whales tour the low seas
bellowing the oldies but goodies.
Apes chase monkeys and their morsels
into the jungle canopy out of reach.

And then they fall.
On the ground they are vulnerable;
we are born of their fear.
"Am I okay?" an ape thinks
with no one to ask.

Desperately smashing the marrow 
from a wildebeest femur
with a rock
leaves a haunting echo
in the right hemisphere,
a creative reflection
where the rock breaks the bone.

Tools are born. Weapons too.
And the tremulous,
over-shoulder gaze of the apes
steadies and straightens
as prey become predators.

Lightning strikes, forests raze.
The survivors throw a barbecue to celebrate.
With bloated bellies
the revelers carry the embers
as we continue following the herd.

We grow strong and sleep well, singing campfire songs
and drawing our dreams among the stars
and painting our horrors and triumphs
on cave walls aglow.

Now fed and kept warm
our loins play our cards
in the bonobo games of old.

Those who lay together
stay together for the kids.
All who fertilize are the father,
so tribes form around orgies.
Tribes cross paths
and trade rookies
to spice up the night moves.

The beasts best barbecued
graze across the plains.
We follow.
When they camp out for a fortnight, we follow suit.
We weave the grasses into yurts,
and kick the cow-pies into rows.

Migration ensues,
but next season we return,
to take it easy
choosing to comb
through rows of crops instead,
of chasing those who eat them,
astooping to germ the nosh
we soon learn to prefer.
Yurts embellish as bellies swell.
We make like a tree and plant.

Orgy domes are erected.
Tender sires curry favor.
Rougher curs are ejected
to wank dejected in the shadows.
Frustration boils
their bonobo blood
to chimpy steam.

These violent delights
have violent ends.
"Dreamforce!"
the lovers cry out,
as the chimps have their way.

Safe-words on deaf ears fall.
Tender men rent to bits,
women violated and degraded,
the brutes take the reins.

Gnawing the bones
of the tender fallen,
they rewrite their misdeeds in a song,
with their victims cast as villains,
"Dreamforce!" as their war cry.

So History begins.
The meek enslaved,
we forget the old ways.
Fear reigns.
And those who love to pet
and be pet
become pets.

Beasts we stalk
and strap into yokes
to sleep in pens we keep.

Fields we plow
for crops we crave.
Fields we reap
for fibers we comb
for yarn we spin
for cloth we weave.

Records we keep
on paper we make
from pulp we mash.

Rivers we bend
with trenches we dig
with tools we smith.

Vessels we turn of clay
we slop on wheels
of stone we ground.

To camps around ruts
we wear with wheels
on carts of vessels of goods.

We practice and hone
these civilized ways.
They encode the instructions
as chants, invent gods
to listen, build temples
for chanting. Algorithms
are born. Religion is formed.

We pave roads,
build walls,
trade crops for shells
and morsels and furs
and those who labor in chains.

We stoke the fires
hot enough to smelt
metal from ores
for baubles for wives
and swords for guards
and shackles for slaves.

We hoard grains
and raise armies
to march over mountains
and onto villages,
drumming our steps
on the skins of our victims
stretched taut on rings.
Geometry is discovered.

Pyramids stack up.
We rain-makers,
earth-movers, 
and fire-stokers fear
blade and hate shackle,
but obey those
who shake air in the temple.

Shells and armies,
the air-shakers gather too
our daughters to 
serve in the temple.
