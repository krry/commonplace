# Unders

bananahammocks and prudish frocks
slings and thongs
dinghies and thingies
pampers, diapers, doody didies
backup wipers, tighty whiteys
polka dot can-coozies or
cheeky checkered cheekcheckers
floozy floss or booty bands
bubble wrap, front and back
box bag, package pouch
kielbasa casing, peanut pocket, cashew couch
tiny tuna tins or roast beef baggies
muffin cups and honey pot pans
holders for boulders and
mittens for kittens
fruity looms or pooty tombs
(insert your wombs) bloomers
zooming about the room
superman or looney tunes,
my little pony, house of poon
gimme strawberry shortcake,
cotton is a nice break
from satin and lace,
chafing the waistline
boy shorts get me heart racing
the balzac brewing,
time for tea bag tasting

all this time I'm wasting
expressing drawers and dressers
should be releasing your tresses
and teasing off your dresses

I confess my best efforts
still imagine you undressing
I swing in your private
primal jungle swooping
on your silky vines
your curves and lines,
purple and swollen,
blushing from red wine
