# Drenched

At Witching Hour, Chattanooga,
sit a magician and a fool
in a condo built for Qbert.

The drench comes for us
to wash away the lies and pain
we were taught but failed to learn.

Our hearts lead our feet
out the door to plant hands.
Rain slam giggles
Giggles rain slam

Bathing on the grass head under feet
—handstand crow pose rinse repeat—
we can feel what it is to be
the whole ocean in a drop
of I and I divine.

Trust falls into the squish
of the sponge-once-lawn.
We become the rain and learn its song.

Giggles rain slam
rain slam giggles
