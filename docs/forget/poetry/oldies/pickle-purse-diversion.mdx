# Pickle Purse DiversionPickle Purse in 7th Heaven

a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men

the middle on the densest fenced in
cows and hens is relished by the prizest fen/
-nel seeds and mustard,
spyder gonna bust words that unbrown your turds
make your first meatpurse manburst
seem like a hearse beat worse than Bob Durst
steppin in for Rubin on Licensed to Ill

still I continue fillin up the bill
feelin' up the Beal, Jessica for real
til I consider it a meal

salmon blossom with she-jam and a fat Claussen
yellin who's the boss and Tootsie Roll dancin' sans pants
oui oui like a young Tony Danza in a Hammer stance

(inspiration waning, your turn in ideation training)

Joe:
first and second are the worst daaaaang! third is the best
crystal methin- I will curse slaaaaang! In yo chest
pistols wreckin' burst  baaaaaaaang!  down to rest
fistfulls heck my words staaaaaaaang! and infest
like earwigs in your braaaaaaaain! and undressed
ladies scream my naaaaaaame! while incest
with uncle is your gaaaaaaaaame!  I fuckin guessed.

now you tape it while I scrape it and you take it on the gay tip
and your face hit by my spray shit I mean spray shit not like "hey kid"
but like spray shit out my aaaa nis and lets face it your mom hates it
when I rapes it like an ape hit with a makeshift enzyte spaceship.

my cripes! snap! fifty states!
I wipes crap! In you face!

im hot like tahiti- mean. . .
you'll get shot like cabrini. . . green
ill get the best of you let the gat go I seen me yo soul
all that's left of you is a shadow like bikini atoll
im eatin your skin like idi amin
and seedin women while bleedin within
and feastin again on your weakness for men
while my feces begins to mistreat your christian
beliefs and your sin which leads me to grin
cause your sheepish mind and weak brain
make you follow the cathleek train
or the muslim or whatever
and your lifelong endeavor
floats away like a feather
while youre feelin kind of clever
will you go to heaven? never.

Dan:
my first verse ain't got one curse to nurse the fetus of the worst
to disperse all along the entire planet earth,
but even worse, its like the very first time you see your girl's tampon in her purse.
I'm a lyrical assassin with a thug style fashion,
spittin out lyrics, bustin' rhymes with a passion
hittin up the sistas from the fingaz to the fistaz
askin all the mistas for two dollars to holla for a spritza.

the mainframe of the insane has a name that can blame
the rain with milli vanilli on a train to stain the game
like a mr. T chain on the brain pulsin at the vein
to maintain the shape of a paper crane in the rain.
fast lane to mary jane is just a flame to tame
lying lame with no one to blame but the man who took aim
to train the second generation asian to claim his fame.

takin' each section of his confession just to get some direction
of the lesson taught with a session for the sake of reflection
is inscribed with rejection from the lady with the injection
wishin that the decision of her place and position
is directly related to her superstition on the plane of existin
in a world insistin on a nuclear mission to pump the piston
of a transfunctional engine.

i can molest the game in a way to stay away from
the monkeys who save the day in every which way
who play in a concrete rainforest of destruction everyday.
live for the day, work for the week,
fuck what you heard, love what you see?
too bad that i'm too busy for my hair to get frizzy,
but who is he?...me? nah the man in the jacuzzi
with the hivvy jivvy who likes to get dizzy like walt disney
gettin busy with some bitches gettin jiggy.
word.

Kerry:
my second verse remains tight and terse
deeply immersed in the main fight first
veins in my brain burst at the strain
of running this ghost passenger train
creepily I thirst for Kim Basinger's off-sprang
Baldwin baby (who names their children Ire-land)
If you called in lately to Entertainment Daily
I'd refer to you gay-ly and incinerate you playfully.
