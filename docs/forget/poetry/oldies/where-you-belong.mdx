title: Where You Belong
---
# Where You BelongThe lights may be on but who flipped the switch
Is he lurking in your shadow tryin' to hide away
Let him go, it's where he belongs

And now your eyes are opened, you're safe & warm
You wanna share your smile but there's no one home
Let it go, you're where you belong
