## Track 4
# I have no melody

The song remained the same.
I listened, harkened, gleaned,  
but the song sang out instead.  
These lyrics found their field.

I rake the weeds,  
I'll comb the turf.  
If you'll give me space  
I'll give you time.

The part where we part  
is a sad pop in timeâ€”
far off and unsought.  
We wound together,
we'll find our sets.

The song will sing itself.  
The tune will find itself.  
You can help, you all can.  
My ears will stay wide open.

I have no melody,  
only these spare words.
I have no refrain.
I have only this moment  
and these beats are yours.
