# Time is the currency

## Track 2

Beat out my heart.
Thump my chest till I'm alive.
Count the resonance inside.
I will die first
and you will last.

Our lives are measured
in beats per infinity,
our hearts in open arms.
Our minds are labyrinthine.
Your smile determines mine.

One thing I only knew:
How good it is to see you!
To be with you.
To be or not,
to be within you.
For you. With you. Of you.

This song is more than I could write.
Your love is more than I could bear.
Your life is hard and soft.
Your arms grow stronger still.

Heartbeats tick awayâ€”
the only true accounts.
Your beat has played with mine
as my mind has you.

We've got a few more beats
before I touch the sky,
before I let go,
before I cry to die.
