# Track 11
# Rhone meets Rhine

Rivers fed by winter ice
flow downhill and intertwine.  
Comets pass and wonder why. 
Fillies run, billies goat,  
hooters blink an eye.

Pools cool us until we chill,
but breathing water's dead up ill.
Dale would have us influence
only as our friends would have it be.

Your struggle is your own.
If you don't own it, no one will.
Your ass is brown, bleach it away.
Your struggle is real.
I'm a particle in your universe.
But you can hear me.

Who comes next needs fresh water.
Euphrates my Tigress
and I'll swim in your Ganges.
But the next two that matter
will be Rhone and/or Rhine.
