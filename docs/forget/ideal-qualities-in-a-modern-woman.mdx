# Ideal Qualities in a Modern Woman

- practiced: strong and toned, lithe and svelte, skilled, deliberate
- rhythmic: lives and breathes music; feels the deeper rhythms
- headstrong: stubborn as I am, willing to lock horns
- radiating: pulses with energy, reds, yellows, fire
- self-possessed: loves herself, finds pleasure with herself
- open: to anything enriching, to the big wild, to the learnings of past faults, and the lessons of future mistakes
- sensual: tastes like Aphrodite, her pheromones are my ambrosia mixed with some oxytocin of course
- natural: smells like Diana, i.e. herself and some delicious running through the woods sweat
- therapeutic: teach me how to loosen up, show me how to relax, calm my beast
- fun: plays like a her inner child would
- animal: cleans up/gets messy at will
- confidence: gives and takes feedback without asking for it or balking at it
