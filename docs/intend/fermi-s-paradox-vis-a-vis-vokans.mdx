# Fermi's paradox vis-a-vis Vokans

They are here.
They are us.
They zoo us.
They were here in higher dimensions.

They exist but are silent save for high-D signals.
They can read minds, but have nothing to ask.
They are retired.

They don't exist
not like we do
this is our garden
our life is a simple playdoh version of a Vokan.
