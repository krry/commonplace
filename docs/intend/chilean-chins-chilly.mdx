# dust nugget preamble

Today I read
Khalil Gibran's
The Prophet
Two days ago
I read
Jessica Semaan's
Child of the Moon
Today I write
this that follows
Yesterday I read
Aldous Huxley's
The Doors of Perception
Yesterday I give
up writing
because words are
not enough as
Huxley observes
Today Gibran
changes my mind
Two days ago Semaan's
words are enough

I hope this follows
This is the only
hope I hold to
I follow Semaan's lead

Tomorrow I find a blank book
I fill it with song
from the source
as it flows through me

And leave it alone until
those wonders I love
and am blissing to know
can publish it through
my last wall of fears

The paintings take
moar time
to dry than our tears
to heal than our fears
do when we charge
rhino headlong into
ourself
