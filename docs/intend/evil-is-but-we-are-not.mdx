# Evil is, but we are not

Almost any allegiance leaves us safely separate from evil, ensconced in the assumption of righteousness. Be it fandom for a sports ball team, belonging to a family or sacred order, practicing a religion or adopting a faith, we assume the moral high ground.

Yes, evil exists, but we are not evil. The others are evil, and we are saved, we are good at heart, we are sinner's who receive mercy/salvation/grace.
