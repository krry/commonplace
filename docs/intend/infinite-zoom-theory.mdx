# Infinite Zoom Theory

As our scopes see farther and smaller, we conceive of the universe as expanding and more particulate. The looping, recursive, fractal shape of the world (Ouroboros) allows us to zoom infinitely in or out never reaching the bare metal, even within a finite universe.

The complexity of the universe, then, can increase just out of pace of our comprehension. Shifted slightly, ignorance outpaces knowledge.
