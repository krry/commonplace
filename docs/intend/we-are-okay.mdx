# We are okay

Without the proper context and a broad enough variety of perspectives, it is no surprise that many of us struggle to know that we are okay.

Let's recount the story of human culture we are all but force-fed by the fearmongers a.k.a. media:

There is evil in the world, pure unadulterated evil.

Nature, red in tooth and claw, brims with mindless beasts murdering each other. And it will consume you, infect you, tear you apart, unless you can smell it coming and avoid it, or turn and fight and somehow vanquish the demons.

Even if you can get the best of evil, it never stays down. Evil will come back with a vengeance drink up your milkshake.

All you can do is keep your head down and try to rake in as much as you can. Unless of course our glorious technology can one day bend evil Nature to our whim and will.

Total control is the goal. A techno-totalitarian utopia is our only hope.

Sound familiar? Probably not. The euphemism is missing, the subliminal threat is on the surface. That's not how we sell eyeballs!
