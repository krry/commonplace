# There is plenty for everyone

Abundance is the default state of existence.

> The Way bears one.
> The one bears two.
> The two bear three.
> The three bear the ten thousand things.
>
> â€” Tao Te Ching #42 as interpreted by Ursula K. Le Guin

This tenet is the mirror image of another dominant theme in the story of human culture: resources are scarce. While it may be true that we cannot have everything we want, it is this wanting, this insatiable desire, that creates the scarcity we often treat as ineradicable.

Abundance emerges as we voice our needs and share our gifts. Things get super easy when we can distinguish the sheep we need from the goats we want.
