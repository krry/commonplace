# Culture, unlike nature, can be quantified

Nature cannot be quantified. When we attempt to count the entities of nature, we must first denigrate their uniqueness, grouping entities with similar properties, sorting them into layers of taxonomy.

`Life > Domain > Kingdom > Phylum > Class > Order > Family > Genus > Species`

By contrast, any figment of culture can be represented with binary numbers.

This is another way of saying that culture is composed of dualities, though often the composing dualities are so many and intricately interwoven that we are unable or at least reluctant to tease them apart.

Nature, on the other hand, comprises non-duality, an integrated whole, a singularity and a union, everything and nothing all at once.
