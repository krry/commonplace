# Fine grained associations yield dense linking

Topic maps attempts to describe the topology of information, considering fundamentally **Topics**, **Associations**, and **Occurrences**, as I glean from [the TAO of Topic Maps](https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html).

A topic may have many names.
Properties of a topic are called **facets**.
**Scope** is the limit of validity of a topic.
