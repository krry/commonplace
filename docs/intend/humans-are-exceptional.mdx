# Humans are exceptional

This belief underlies a great deal of our (toxic) culture. (Shall we ignore the possibility that [[all culture is toxic]]?)

From [Easeness.biz](https://easeness.biz/humans-are-exceptional-a-business-premise):

> Are we on top? If so, why and how and how can we stay that way? If not, why do so many of us act like we are?
> Do we reign over the animal kingdom? Who says it's a kingdom? Some guy?

> This tenet is the mirror image of one of the core themes of the human story: humans are exceptional. If you don't believe me, do a cursory search for "what makes humans unique". In this vein of separatism, one will discover a host of theories, and [books on each one](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=what+makes+humans+unique+book&ia=web), stretching back into the annals of history. (I'd better rope off a post for another time on this wide spectrum of pseudoscience.)

And here is that post in progress. Let's begin to list the qualities that various humans have posited to make us unique and exceptional among terran denizens.
