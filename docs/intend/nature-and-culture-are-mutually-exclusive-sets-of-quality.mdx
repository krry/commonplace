# Nature and culture are mutually exclusive sets of quality

Nature includes the phenomena of life, of matter, of sense. The qualia detected by organisms, the forces that affect cosmic bodies, the manifold forms of energy: these are natural.

Culture includes the phenomena of the mind, of imagination, of dreams, of perception. The interpretation of senses, filtered through concepts, translated into language, or frozen as image: these are artificial. When artifice is shared among minds, it becomes culture. Notably culture can ultimately be reduced to pixels or to binary numbers. [[Culture, unlike nature, can be quantified]].
