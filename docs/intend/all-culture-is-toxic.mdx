# All culture is toxic

To stake a claim so bold, I may want to appeal to someone with an extremely developed sense of culture, someone considerably more erudite than myself. Someone like Camille Paglia or Riane Eisler.

If we define culture as the habits and practices we develop and share intentionally, the ones that are not instinctual, natural, or hereditary, we encompass rather a lot while drawing a clear line. [[Nature and culture are mutually exclusive sets of quality]].
