# Dryrun

The place to post about things you are learning
Logo melds the nu to be un alternately
Layout starts mobile, espouses all new responsive design concepts
Is very variable = very-able!
Color palette uses bars
Textures for backgrounds, organic
Taken from pictures of my environs
Local weather affects styles, layout
Audio everywhere subtly
User tunable, font size, crowding-wise
320x320 is the central block, lego style
Always include 4px on the sides of a text div
