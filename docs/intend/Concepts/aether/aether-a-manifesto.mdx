# AETHER, a manifesto

The data that describe you belong to you, but they are held captive on servers and platforms all over the world. All these billions of bytes paint a hidden picture of you: what you look like, where you go, what you say, who you know, what you buy, all stored in one non-existent, personal database. What you wear, how you style yourself, what you carry around is an imperfect expression of your true self, perhaps masked by many layers of social anxiety, by filters you have adopted to better fit in.

I believe we can dress ourselves in our data, that we can wear our inner truths on our sleeves, around our neck, on our wrists, even on the soles of our shoes. I believe we can radically express ourselves and find great freedom, community, and happiness in doing so.

To expand on Dawkins' concept of the organism as survival machine for the selfish gene, I believe we conscious beings are each APIs who can define our methods for how we want to GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

Those we meet that match our methods, those that introduce the fewest errors into our logs will be the ones we want with us. We'll want to make strong, lasting bonds with them, regardless of changes in space-time or name.

We can dress our homes in our data as well. Imagine an interactive wall in your home that feels your feels and shows your truth. You could use your hands to move your data around, customize your home's home page.

Even a truth not ready to be told can be recorded as a message in a bottle with a homing beacon to resurface when the time is right to whoever needs to know.
