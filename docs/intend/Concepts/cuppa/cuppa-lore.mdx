# Cuppa Lore

Coffee originated in Kaffa, a region of Ethiopia where it is called *buno*. Some 600 years ago, Sufis in Yemen developed the modern preparation of coffee: pick the cherries, roast their pits, grind them up, boil them in water, and drink the broth. They called it *qahhwat al-bun*, "the wine of the bean". To them it was a stimulating improvement on the tea they had recently tasted from Zheng He's Ming dynasty-sponsored flotilla.

Since then coffee has followed civilization, and vice versa. But no matter how civilized we may be, I doubt we will agree on the perfect cup of coffee. Your taste is as unique as your fingerprint.
