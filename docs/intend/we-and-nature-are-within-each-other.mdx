# We and nature are within each other

Evolution twirls on, yin defining yang defining yin. Within any other being sits the same source of self that we hold in our heart. And yet we continue to delude ourselves that we can get the best of Nature, or fearing that we will be devoured if we do not maintain control.

This fear is quite rational and well-founded. In nature, everything is food for something. Even the molten sulfur pools that gird the descent into the abyss at Challenger Deep have their extremophilic, microbial gastronomes. And though we may cremate our fallen, this makes them food for the flames. No one can escape this simple fate, though endeavoring to try does keep us mighty busy building rockets and pedaling Pelotons.

Must we fear one day being eaten? How might we live differently, were we to embrace our role in the cycle that vitally nourishes us? Bury me beneath a sapling cherry tree, and I'll see that it becomes a Kerry tree.
