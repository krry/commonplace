# Bumps in the Foamy Dev Trail

I set out to use [[foamy-nextjs]] to publish my second brain, most of which exists as markdown, and much of which contains useful metadata. So that meant I needed to figure out how to use [[frontmatter-in-foamy-nextjs]]. And many of my notes did not have front matter yet, so I found a way to [[automagically-prepend-front-matter]] to those 900-some files.

Once the frontmatter was figured, I had a new bump to hump: [[how-to-case-links-in-a-commonplace]]

[//begin]: # 'Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility'
[foamy-nextjs]: foamy-nextjs 'Foamy NextJS Starter'
[frontmatter-in-foamy-nextjs]: frontmatter-in-foamy-nextjs 'Frontmatter In Foamy NextJS'
[how-to-case-links-in-a-commonplace]: how-to-case-links-in-a-commonplace 'How to Case Links in a Commonplace'
[//end]: # 'Autogenerated link references'
