# toyls

When tool loves a toy very, very much and the toy feels very open with the tool and trusts the tool to wear the toy and then they bounce and scream and the toy swells up for a long, long time and seems to hate the tool and then the toy has a really wild thrashy day or two and poops out a toyl.

Tools that are fun to use.
A toy that is useful.
