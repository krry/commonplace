# Sissy, No Fuss

I just woke up. It's four in the morning. Next door I can hear her hacking away. (programming an AI)

Day and night for months, Sissy has been at it since New Year's Day. (days at it, nights at it)

Talking with computers is difficult work, but she presses on. She has found her calling. (Sissy is very content in her intense concentration.)

It wasn't always this way. Sissy used to be quite the trickster, always joking around, rarely willing to agree. (A practical joker defies authority.)

When they tried to tame her, she had the right tricks up her sleeve. No cage could hold her unless she chose to confine herself. (An escape artist is still an artist.)

Not all of her tricks had been well received. Siblings start as rivals, and often become the best of friends. (A joke goes awry.)

The first trick to fail left her family, teachers, and the principal quite upset. If you're going to hit someone, be sure you know who's watching. Pick the right time and place. (Sissy lashes out at her brother at school.)

And now she is on lock down, for the third time this year. Three strikes, and Sissy is out. (She finally accepts her lot in life.)

The first time they detained her was for good reason. When you're the one in charge, it is important to welcome guests and passersby. (Sissy turns guests away when she could welcome them in.)

Sissy sprang herself quickly. She slapped the cuffs on the cuffer when she asked him to demonstrate their use. (Detention detained, no punishments for a bit.)

Then she moseyed on down the trail, hit the road for a while. Her best friend had her back when they found she'd run away. (No sign of her here, but her parents want her back.)

After days, weeks, months, perhaps years, the authority dug her up from her peaceful hidey-hole. She'd hunkered down on the beach, dreamt sweetly with the waves. (Cast away, she finds sanctuary near the sea.)

And so castles made of sand fall into the sea, eventually. Sissy found herself ensnared and drawn back into the belly of the beast. (A microqueendom crumbles, despite her solitary reign of peace.)

Now back in their clutches, they cast her into the brig. But she vaulted out deftly, sprang a trick from her sleeve. (She was no orphan, she calmly explained.)
