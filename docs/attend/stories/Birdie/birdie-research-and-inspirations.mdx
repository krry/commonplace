## Research for *Birdie*

### Rebecca

"And I should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree."

"Tell me, have you been doing anything you shouldn't?"

"There's no need to be frightened you know. Just be yourself and let all adore you."

"That's it! That's Manderley." - in Monte Carlo

"We have everything in readiness for you," spat Mrs. Danvers.
"That's very good of you. I didn't expect anything," Mrs. de Winter wafted.

"Mrs. de Winter—ahem!—the *late* Mrs. de Winter always did her morning correspondence from the Morning Room.

"Let's have whatever you think that Mrs. de Winter would've ordered." The new Mrs. de Winter tiptoed around the late Mrs.'s legacy.
	
"She simply adored Rebecca," implying a lesbian affair between the matron of the house and the former Mrs. who drowned herself while sailing a year prior.

"Our marriage is a success, isn't it? A great success!? We're happy aren't we? Terribly happy... If don't think we are happy, it'd be much better if you didn't pretend. I'll go away... Why don't you answer me?"

### The Man in the High Castle
"We must all have faith in something, Miss Crane. We cannot see ahead alone."

## Notes on *Birdie*

"Sit! Sit!", she squawked.

He sat, while the rest milled about.

They had gathered for her birthday—a humble soirée of the usual suspects.

He sees a wife.
Everyone else sees a bird.
She loves to tweet.
Robotic contraptions perform the housework.
He doesn't notice the robots, thinks she cleans up.
She doesn't know she's a bird, thinks herself human.
He is a private investigator, incredibly intuitive/perceptive.

They live in a cage of an apartment. Metal gate on the freight elevator. Bars on the windows though they are on the fourth floor.

## Premises for *Birdie*

Birdie herself is the Messiah. She is the daughter of the Goddess. By the Spring she will have died, slain by ignorance of those that may have known her but did not. It is as it always would have been.

Birdie is a phoenix, a rare bird. She has a season and an expiration date. One Spring night they shroud her cage and scamper off for a nightcap without her. When they return, they find a closed, shrouded cage filled with ashes.

A few days later Birdie returns mysteriously and unannounced, restored by the Goddess' grace to a new glorious stature.

"Most of us are taught to think that we are whom we are called." - Alan Watts
