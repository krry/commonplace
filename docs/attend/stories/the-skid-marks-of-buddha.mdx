## Sasplotch Sighted: Wednesday, 10:22 p.m., Los Angeles, my bathroom

As I clambered into the epsom for a soak and a soothe, my eyes leapt down to my thigh where, overnight, half of a crimson Rorschach birthmark had blotted itself, evidence of an injury I didn't recall. "Fuck me! Ow, what the fuck!" It had just been me, Kanye, Netflix, the PS4, and a Tsar Bomba of Russian Standard since Monday.

I glitched out for a second in disbelief. Then my eyes caught a glimpse of another patch—this one deeper red, almost purple—peeking around the corner from my lower back/upper butt. Craning and twisting, I flashed back to one of those toddler epiphanies: "Can't look at my back!" So I dropped my ass into the hot magnesium, thinking I could twist around further and not have a home-alone bathtub accident if I was seated. The heat of the bath registered as acid sting on my thigh and across my lower back. This shit was real—the patches weren't washing off. I completed a twitchy, cursory bath so as not to fully waste the epsom salts, dismounted the tub, and gingerly toweled off.

My disbelief became electrified panic as I swiveled my backside toward the bathroom mirror. A constellation of rosy red splotches extended from hip to hip over my butt and down the outside of my right thigh. Each splotch was a different size and shape, with no rhyme or reason in their layout or distribution. Jackson Pollack might have admired the stochastic paint job on my dermis. No bruises, contusions, cuts, or abrasions—just this massive bloody Sasplotch. I had photo evidence that it wasn't there the night before.

I snapped five supremely awkward selfies of my new splotch-stellation, then went to panic-stalk around the living room where I called **O**, who was away on business. She agreed from the photos I sent that this was not an upgrade and helped me walk through the possibilities.

Could it have been the epsom salts?

ME
No unlikely, those are good for skin.

O
Did you put any essential oils in the bath?

ME
No, not tonight. Last night I did, but I ended up giving that bath to the dog instead, so that couldn't be it.

We said our goodbyes. I popped three milligrams of melatonin to coax the Sandman in for the night. He had other plans, so I tossed and turned and flipped through hundreds of images of rashes and skin conditions. Panning through this endless mosaic of human skin disease did nothing to settle my mind. It didn't take long for disgust and despair to overwhelm me. No matches for my malady. I would have to pick up the query tomorrow and see how my condition developed.

Wednesday became Thursday in three shakes, forty winks, and a nod off. I popped up to assess the situation. No change. I'm a mutant now. Or rather I have the largest, most elaborate birthmark I've ever seen, and no additional powers.

I busied myself with chores and todos while a freakout simmered. I don't deal well with broad changes to my well-being that I can't explain—which isn't a criticism, I doubt anyone does. But I'm saving the juicy, disparaging bits for later, because that's how they showed up for me.

## Self-assessment: Thursday, 1:30 p.m.

It doesn't itch, and is about as tender as a Klingon trampstamp. It has not noticeably changed in shape, contour, or character for the seventy-two hours since it appeared. Extensive photographic proof is available upon request—DM me a [SASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-addressed_stamped_envelope) ℅ _Klingon Trampstamp Birthmark Timelapse_.

This is not a stain from drinking wine wrong, or from a live, all-beet Fruit Ninja demonstration.

And praise the All-One-God-Faith, this is not necrotizing fasciitis. **DO NOT GOOGLE THAT**. Also do not use tele-dermatology services such as Spruce or SkyMed unless you want to run the risk of being responsibly—dare I say, Hippocratically—warned that you may have a voracious strain of bacteria munching its merry way through the entirety of your muscles—a strain that finishes one-in-four of its meals in one to four days, if you catch my drift.

## All jokes aside, this was really scary.

To the team at White Memorial's emergency room, thank you from the bottom of my still-beating heart for admitting me without delay and treating me with open hearts and open ears. I was (understandably) dismayed at the tele-dermatologist's suggestion that I may be more than two days into a max four-day spiral of gruesome doom. While you did not make a positive diagnosis, you did rule out my worst fears and several fears I did not know to have until you had dispelled them. And you did it all with kindness and compassion.

**And finally, to my partner, my goddess, how many times will you win my heart?** You allayed my paranoia and worry with kind sensibility, you soothed me with such ease. Heck, you even rocked my mutating body with your divine self (and mouth) despite my potentially flesh-eating condition. And the moment we got the terrifying news from the tele-derm, you dropped everything and took me to the hospital—a beacon of hope, and sense, and positivity. Those hours I would have spent in the shadow of my mortality passed happily in the supernatural glow that only your love can generate. I am forever yours, at your service, and by your side.

## This turned out to be a prank I pulled _literally_ on myself.

Guess how I found out? I issued a psychic warning to the perpetrator:

> Turn yourself in immediately. The fervor of my retaliation will compound in dreadfulness like the private loans from your eleventh and final semester at University of Phoenix—Detroit. They will haunt you like the plague this may turn out to actually be a symptom of.

It turns out the plague is me. I plague myself with stupidity, pride, and impatience in the face of my ignorance. So in the spirit of growth and progress, here's what really happened:

By Tuesday I was halfway through a handle of Russian Standard. This was not an unusual pace of alcohol consumption for me. Over the years, I have developed one ability with distinct focus, perhaps more than any other. That is my ability to agonize the GABA swimming around in my brain with alcohol, with phenibut, with GHB. This ability yields a whole host of whatever the opposite of a superpower is. Let's call it a grundlick.

One of my grundlicks is baseline, soul-dissolving anxiety. I feel anxious almost all the time. You can witness physically manifesting as I incessantly gnaw and nibble the loose bits of a flesh from the insides of my cheeks and lips. It might seem like I'm wearing an ill-fitting mask chimeric abomination of an ouroboros and a remora, and a bundle of nerves. It's a subtle tick, right? Maybe no one notices. Or maybe they can feel my Generalized Anxiety Multilevel Mindfuck Array ripping through them like the gamma rays that paint the ghostly birth of the universe in the cosmic background. Now can you feel it? There it is.

Throughout the years I've treated and exacerbated my GAMMA with obsession and addiction. One problem begets another. Fear begets fear.

Grundlick numero duo is subtle depression founded in existential oblivion.
