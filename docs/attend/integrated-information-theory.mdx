# Integrated Information Theory

All entities in the field possess some ability to integrate information. This is an expression of the consciousness of the entity. We can measure this ability to integrate information by mapping the flux of information over the contours and shapes in the field.

Giulio Tononi and his team are developing an experimental framework whereby we can measure the consciousness of anything. Panpsychism made science.
