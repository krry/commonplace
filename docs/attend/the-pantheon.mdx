# The Pantheon

- When dreaming of the nature of consciousness, Thomas Nagel asks "What is it like to be a bat?"
  - What other beings might it be something to be like?
  - What is it like to be a tree? A bee? A mountain? A lake? The Earth? The Moon?
- So I'd like to posit what we'll for now call the [[greater-minds-theory]]
