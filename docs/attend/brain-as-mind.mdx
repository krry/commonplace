# Brain As Mind

- [[memory]] is not uniformly destroyed when brain tissue is removed or destroyed.
- Karl Lashley trained rats, monkeys, and chimps to solve puzzles, then removed their motor cortex, cerebellum, and severed cross-connections in the cerebral cortex to no detriment of memory among his subjects
- Formation of memory often activates the median temporal lobes, esp. the hippocampus, but removal of the hippocampus does not impact recall profoundly or predictably.
- A man with 5% of the typical human brain tissue due to hydrocephalus has earned university degree with a demonstrated IQ of 126.
- Rhythmic patterns or resonance across time of electrical signals throughout the brain are shown to map mental activity and recall more closely than synapse maps or circuits.
- Awareness of sensation generally operates an a half-second delay. [[readiness-potential]]
  - Typically the decision to move a finger occurs 200 ms after awareness of the decision,
  - which tends to occur 300 ms after the motor cortex initiated the reactive movement.
