# G.I. Gurdjieff

- star of Ouspensky's _In Search of the Miraculous_

[George Ivanovich Gurdjieff](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/George_Gurdjieff)

I first encountered Gurdy through a few paradoxical aphorisms in Be Here Now

Thus began a lengthy study that ended in wishing to travel through time that I might whirl like a dervish in his tutelege, that I might get snowed in deep in the Russian wilderness and relearn how to breathe for months
