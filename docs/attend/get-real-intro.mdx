# Synopsis

The only thing I know for sure is that I am conscious. Everything else might be false. I could deny anything that exists solely within my mind until it is no longer true to anyone including myself. I don't like ice cream. And I don't love you anymore. There. Done. See?

And some splendid skeptic might disprove anything outside my mind that anyone believes is true. The Earth was flat, now it's round. The speed of light is a constant but it may fluctuate. The universe sprang suddenly forth from nothingness and chaos. God said, "Let there be Light." There was a Big Bang.
