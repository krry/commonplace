budding gardener-chef-brewer
storybook writer
poet-as-pupa
yantric artist
esoteric acolyte
card-carrying un-ist
loving awareness

And truly I am none of these nouns, these bubbles
I am always only echoing in the vibratory field
of being-knowing-enjoying
I am embodying patterns in the foam emerging still and silent
from the well of being seated at the core of our heart-center.
