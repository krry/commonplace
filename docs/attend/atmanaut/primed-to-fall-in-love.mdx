# Primed To Fall In Love

## On Love, Day One

It's February again, already.

> Cupid, draw back your bow-ooh-whoaâ€¦

Suddenly there are "Jamies" all over the place. Today was tomorrow yesterday. Practically all your Google Search results contain "Jamie"... Wait a sec, did Facebook get hacked? More like Jamiebook... Welp, gonna need another bottle of Jamieson. Has it always been spelled like that? ... No way, nice license plate `JMEROX`! ... Even the evening news is in on it. "Grimshaw County police investigate a spree of hit-and-runs this afternoon. Tune in at 10 to find out how it's all Jamie's fault."

Psychologists call this phenomenon _priming_. It's akin to a fitness technique called "greasing the groove". As the theory goes and practice validates, when learning a new movement that requires strength and coordination, e.g. a pull-up, the optimal strategy is to playfully, patiently, sporadically complete the movement, never to exhaustion, never to failure, but always correctly. Our bodies are very capable of growing to accommodate our intent, if we treat them (ourselves) with love. But don't take my word for it. There are oodles of [testimonials from the groove greasers](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9zrpga/grease_the_groove_is_truly_a_miracle/) out there.

Which brings me to what inspired today's post. Last March I heard Tom Campbell utter four little words in [an interview on YouTube](https://youtu.be/U5_z4C6LNKw?t=702). (It was a different interview, but this is a more succinct framing of his deductive reasoning.) A switch flipped. Suddenly everything made sense. Our purpose became clear, and my tribulations vaporized. I haven't been the same since.

I've spent every waking moment since then trying to figure out what to do with this new understanding, how to communicate it, who to share it with. Alan Watts' _The Way of Zen_ offered me some relief when it lent me a vocabulary for what I had experienced. In short it was a moment of satori. But it's been a trip since then, and I'm slowly emerging from the swirling nebula of bliss and wonderment that consumed me that fateful day. That's why we're both here right now.

First I read Tom's book, which was a doozy. [Here's my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2316010950). And while I can't agree wholly with his Big Theory of Everything, he is right about **one thing**: love is the answer, to any question worth asking, and many we struggle to answer but could just as well release unsettled.
