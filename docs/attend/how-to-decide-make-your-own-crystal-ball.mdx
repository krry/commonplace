# How to Decide: Make Your Own Crystal Ball

In Annie Duke's new book she offers us a pretty cut and dried process for decisions.

Starts by defining "resulting" as using the quality of an outcome to figure the quality of the decision. Resulting blinds us to decision quality.

The end doesn't justify the means; a good or bad outcome doesn't imply a good or bad decision or vice versa.

Hindsight isn't 20/20. Our view of the past is as fuzzy as that of the future. A crystal ball would be extremely helpful at clarifying our view of other spacetimes, and unrealized possible pasts, presents, and futures.

Outcomes overshadow via hindsight bias "should've known!"

"Should've known" is usually false and rarely helpful. "Could've known" refocuses on knowables to seek and unknowables to note amidst the decision process.

Counterfactuals aka what-ifs can ground us in what is and remind us of the role of luck in the outcomes we experience.

> What if the earth had been flat or square?

Knowledge tracking maps our guesses, confidence probabilities, pay-offs, and blindspots.

Perspective tracking shifts to the outside view then back within to reframe one's position and options in the situation.

Remapping the decision tree for good and bad outcomes gives us back the multiverse. "We have to find symmetry in our willingness to explore all outcomes."

## Six Steps to Better Decision-Making

Decisions and their possible outcomes => preference for each payoff | probability of payoff

| decision        | outcome      | likelihood | payoff | cost |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ---- |
| co-found summon | ipo          | 1/20000    | $20M   | 4yrs |
| co-found summon | crash & burn | 95%        | $0     | 4yrs |

Adopt the Archer's mindset and take aim. Everything is a guess. Better to educate our guesses, but still shoot.

Using likelihood language whenever possible (rather than always absolutes), helps us express (and articulate) our often-unspoken, but intrinsic, probability judgments.

We are innately and enormously ignorant. Gazing through the Johari window, we can plainly see that the unknown unknowns abound, unknown knowns nearly rival them, while the known unknowns far and exceedingly surpass the known knowns which are slim to none.

Beliefs -@-> Decision -$-> Outcome
@ imperfect information adjusts our beliefs
$ luck intervenes without our control

Our beliefs need more examination, more evaluation, and more explicit expression (or disavowment). Overconfidence is a major threat to making high quality decisions.

These Mauboussins have a real possibility of being onto something useful. Or did we already know that most folks typically don't use words nearly the same or very well? Perhaps converting our likelihood words into percentages, which we record and share and review, could help our chances as making better estimates and communicating them accurately.

Signaling uncertainty (with ranges) enables receivers of the signal to help refine your aim. Important for leaders! And really anyone.

The inside view invites a host of biases subject to and applying to our beliefs, perspective, and experiences.

Friends can and will disagree with us in good faith. Let us be grateful for this kindness, and return it.

## Quit-to-itiveness and Avoiding Choice Paralysis

Keep cost-to-quit low so you can stack a bunch of decisions that might yield positive outcomes. This is how to have a lot of wins. Also quit readily before the negative outcomes get you. It's not int-uitive, it's quit-uitive.

## Negative Thinking

Let's get you **_satisficed_**! It's hard to know enough to maximize, so suffice it to say satisfaction is sufficient.

Start at the summit in the future, then plot your route past all the obstacles and challenges back to where you are today. Employ the outside view, then step back into your own shoes.

Looking back from the Summit with the Outside View can show us the obstacles from a vulnerable vantage.

And when eliciting feedback, we can poison the conversation with our opinions and beliefs. It's important to quarantine our perspective and ask strong open-ended questions directed at collecting the missing information for this hypothetical decision. "But why?" as a child would ask can lead the interview to the root of the matter.

## Perspective tracking

We start in the outside view, anchoring there on a base rate. From the outside view we enable a greater chance of reaching shared understanding. Then we move inward, discovering where we are (out) standing in the field.
