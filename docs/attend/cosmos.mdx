# Cosmos and Quanta

## Gravity

Does gravity take time to apply?
Or does matter have an innate affinity for matter?

[The other half of the theorized matter of the Universe was recently discovered to exist as baryons, which link our galaxies together with filaments of hot, diffuse gas.](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2149742-half-the-universes-missing-matter-has-just-been-finally-found/)

Matter fields, whose quanta are fermions (e.g., leptons and quarks)
Electrons and neutrinos are charged and neutral leptons respectively.
Quarks compose baryons (tri-quarks) like neutrons and protons.

Force fields, whose quanta are bosons (e.g., photons and gluons)

Both types of fields demonstrate zero-point energy (also called zero-point field, Nullpunktsenergie, zero-point radiation, or vacuum energy).

Zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. It is observed when matter is cooled to near absolute zero. Helium will not freeze at atmospheric pressure due to zero-point energy. It becomes superfluid. The uncertainty principle requires every quanta to have a fluctuating ZPE greater than the minimum of its potential well. This observed vacuum energy reintroduces æther into physics.

Dark matter has yet to be detected.

Dark energy has yet to be detected, though 68% of the mass-energy density of the universe is currently attributed to it in the form of the [cosmological constant](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cosmological_constant) (Λ) in the ΛCDM model. The vast discrepancy between the theoretically projected value of the cosmological constant and the empirically-based estimate is between 60 and 120 orders of magnitude.

### Anthropic principle

The fundamental physical constants of the universe are sufficient and appropriate at this unique point in time and space to allow and support intelligent living observers like us.

Strong anthropic principle: "The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history." - John Barrow and Frank Tipler, *The Anthropic Cosmological Principle*

Weak anthropic principle: "our location in the universe is necessarily privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers" - Brandon Carter

We can simplify this greatly. If things were different, we wouldn't be here and now. We wouldn't be observing **this**. In fact, looking at this moment through the lens of chaos theory and the Butterfly Principle, any tiny change sufficiently far in the past could have led our experience of the universe in this moment to be wildly different. So we can say, without any hope of proof or danger of disproof, that things could not have happened any other way. We have never been able to repeat the choices made in any moment differently.
