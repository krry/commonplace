# Physics today - a brief overview

## quantum field theory

- the fundamental structure of physical reality is a wiggly field that behaves like discrete particles governed by forces (The Standard Model)
- 12 particle fields
  - electron, electron neutrino, up quark, down quark
  - muon, muon neutrino, strange quark, charm quark
  - tau, tau neutrino, bottom quark, top quark
- 4 fundamental forces
  - gravity - spacetime - graviton field
  - electromagnetism - EM field
  - strong nuclear - gluon field
  - weak interaction - W boson, Z boson fields
- charge - interaction of electron field with EM field
- mass - interaction of electron field with gravity

## unsolved mysteries abound

- beginning of universe
- quantum gravity
- zero field energy
- dark energy - accelerating expansion
- dark matter - bends in spacetime due to invisible sources of gravity
- grand unification - unites matter fields
- supersymmetry - unites matter and force fields
- string theory - generalizes the standard model as a whole - untestable

## Quantum fluctuations

- result from heisenberg uncertainty principle "no sitting still"
- one of the million dollar maths problems
- began 10^-30^ seconds after the Big Bang

## Constructor theory

## Integrated Information Theory

## Quantum Cosmology

The farther we can look, the more there is to see. As though new edges of the heavens collapse into being as we become able to observe them. Similarly, the closer we look at the building blocks of matter and energy, the more possibilities emerge. And they wait to resolve into actuality until we conscious observers cast our gaze upon them.

At every scale from infinite to infinitesimal, cosmos to boson, we notice that reality materializes before our eyes. But we can't imagine that to be the case.
