### From [[2018-05-11]]

- Those that portray your relationship with yourself can be accurately described as existential motions because your awareness is a localized form of [[satchitananda]]. Hence you are not other than existence, and all emotions arise from your motion in relation to existence. #[[steve-kaufman]]
  - Positive emotions arise when your awareness moves toward an experience of [[unity]], toward your true self as a localized node of awareness, a drop of the unseen, endless ocean of [[cnxns]].
  - Negative emotions indicate that you are moving away from your true [[self]], toward an [[experience]] of [[separation]], isolation, denial, or division.
- Your [[ego]] is your [[awareness]]' definition of itself as an [[identity]] separation from everything else. The ego lives on the story of separation.
  - A strong [[ego]] leads you to [[experience]] yourself in [[separation]] from [[existence]] which induces [[fear]] arising from the resulting experience of possible non-existence aka [[death]].
  - If you think you are separate from everything, then you can imagine that you might cease to be while everything else continues to be.
  - The [[ego]] in attempting to shield you from your fear of non-existence (which is often attenuated and molded into [[death]], inadequacy, injury, embarrassment, rejection, or failure) can fool you into building barriers of [[separation]] with counterfeit good feelings.
- Emotion, then, is the clearest indicator you have that your intentions are good and inline with the [[flow]] of [[existence]], or bad and based on a delusional [[identity]] that you experience as separate from everything else.

[[2018-06-07]]::

- The [[source]] of emotion is the wellspring of [[existence]], the [[the-well-of-being]], where your individual Atman taps into the water table atop the bedrock of [[cnxns]].
- If your sense of [[self]] is true, [[existence]] will [[flow]] into and through you (much like the Force), enriching and expanding your drop of awareness, popping your ego bubble, or allowing it to merge with other bubbles to make [[foam]]
- You experience positive emotional pressure.
- Emotion, as energy in motion, charges you up when you are aware of your connectedness with everything, or to an attenuated degree when you connect with anything/someone else.
- This charge floods the body, channeled there from the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, to which the charge was directed for distribution, having been received as signals on many scales of interacting complexity by antennae (which essentially comprise and define the [[brain]]) tuned to detect these transmissions amidst the chaotic storm of
- [[morphic-resonance]] that you and I weather and brave from moment to moment.
- Losing a clear sense of yourself clogs the tap or even moves the wellspring into dried up pockets of sediment.
- The emotional pressure you experience becomes negative, straining the integrity of your bubble and your uplink to existence, sucking you dry, draining the ocean from your drop, or letting you dry up without hope of replenishment.
- The sucking, draining negative pressure, like the charge of being in [[flow]], starts at your antennae and propagates through your emotionally dedicated neuronal and neural networks to your body's interoceptive sensory systems, wherewith you can palpably feel your separation and disconnection from All-That-Is [[satchitananda]] as shifts in your internal physical state, as aches, pangs, cramps, stiffness, burning, numbness, and so on.
- Recently some rather maverick neuroscientists began mapping our emotions as physical experiences taking place in regular locations in the human body.
- They found that many to most of us tend to feel similar emotions as similar sensations in similar locations in our bodies.
- e.g.::
- [[anger]] tightens our chests and heats our faces.
- [[fear]] closes our throats and shortens our breath.
- [[love]] melts tensions from our muscles, washes congestion from our organs, glands, and veins, and ignites a warm glow in our chests, throats, cheeks, and [[loins]].
- If you struggle to recognize or distinguish your emotions as they arise, if you think you don't know how you feel, a simple hack is to stop, [[breathe]], and direct your [[attention]] inward, scanning your [[body]] for [[sensation]], registering its readout of your existential energy in motion, then relating that readout to the condition, context, and tone of your mental narrative.
- When I notice myself ruminating on past mistakes, I flip the script of my inner monologue to a cursory [[body]] scan while observing the breath.
- "Breathing? Shallow, irregular.
  Throat tightened.
  Ears tingle, throb with heat.
  Cheeks flush, chest constricted."
- I might guess that this emotion is [[guilt]] or [[shame]], or some cocktail of sadness, [[anger]], and regret. Then I look at the context in which the e-motion arose. Which of my relationships are shifting? How am I feeling more separate?
- On other occasions I notice an emotion first in my body, then track its origin back through my train of thoughts to discern what connection or separation has manifested itself in my body as a physical experience.
- These redundant expressions of emotion reinforce its usefulness as a gauge for how delusional or authentic our perspective of [[self]] may be.
- This might be the [[karma]] gauge.
