# Identity or Sovereignty

A path splits in the city
and that way leads to a bus on fire
while this way goes up a steep hill
to the moon's belt tone in rarefied air.

That way it's masks only mask required.
You can dial in your custom PPE
at wearyouridentity.com
Follow us @facethefacts on IG.

This way is for the naked and brave.
If you need directions, if you ever are lost
you can find your way in the kindness
deep in the eyes of a stranger.

And that way you're going to need a real ID
self-select from under seven stereotypes
to configure your official full body person hood:
sex hair eyes height weight dob
(gender race size shape age)
laser-scanned and 4D-printed
2-day delivery shipped overseas.
Sharpie your name on the tag.
You end at your skin, dear
beautiful meat bag.

Caveat: we are not responsible
for any valuable belongings
left inside.

But this way you have to leave everything behind:
no attachments, no baggage, no identity.
Authenticate with a pledge in the gaze above a smile.

> I am.
> I am loving awareness.
> I hold full responsibility
> for the results of my attempts
> to manifest the endless source
> of loving kindness and joy
> foaming up in the well of being
> at the center, in my heart,
> at the core of who I am.
