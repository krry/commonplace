# EZ water

The fourth phase of water. A gel that forms when water molecules align by polarity to exclude non-water molecules from the area, thus forming an exclusion zone (EZ).

Identified by [Gerald Pollack](https://www.pollacklab.org/), who founded and runs the [Institute of Venture Science](https://ivscience.org/) as well.

Notably, EZ water:

- naturally occurs in the cytoplasm of cells
- spontaneously forms when:
  - liquid water is exposed to radiation at 1200 nm in wavelength (infrared)
  - liquid water is blended or agitated vigorously
  - liquid water comes into contact with EZ water
- can [form a bridge](http://www.i-sis.org.uk/liquidCrystallineWater.php) between pools of water carrying electric current
