# Traveling Thru Quantized Time

- Stardate:: [[April 24th, 2018]] in [[Rockford]]
- originally:: #FN02
- inre:: Tom Campbell and his [[Big TOE]]
- Projecting your consciousness into alternate past or possible future realities is inconsequential to other beings (unless it alters your intentions), but this practice can impact your ignorance as any other personal experience can.
- Precognition and predestination tap into probable future vectors for constrained sets of beings, objects, and energy. Larger sets tend to be easier to foresee because more independent actors yield lower variability in expected outcomes.
  - As such, it is easier to craft a vision of the far future, or of global trends, then to predict tomorrow or the city council's opinions.
- These explorations in the domain of possibilities amount to [[time-travel]] that does not affect the present moment or future moments in manifested reality.
  - (Whether manifested reality is solely physical or also non-physical could be contentious.)
  - The only effect this form of time travel exerts is on the ignorance/entropy/quality of the exploring, observing, choosing [[cnxns]].
  - The consciousness with the smallest time [[quanta]]—`Δt`—sets the fundamental beat for all other conscious beings experiencing persistent state changes as they seek to progress. Campbell calls this the [[AUM]].
