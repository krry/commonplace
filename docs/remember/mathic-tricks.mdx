# Metatronics and Mathic Tricks

**Quintity**: the state of being five.

_See also_ **quality** (the state of being valued), **quantity** (the state of being numerous), and **quility** (the state of being clever).

But let's play with shapes. I like circles and triangles and squares. And dimensions. Adding one takes us from 'gonics' to 'hedronics'.

## Plato's Timeaus

Plato saw it thusly.

| Name         | Vertices | Edges | Faces | Element      |
| :----------- | :------- | :---- | :---- | :----------- |
| Tetrahedron  | 4        | 6     | 4     | Fire         |
| Hexahedron   | 8        | 12    | 6     | Earth        |
| Octahedron   | 6        | 12    | 8     | Air          |
| Icosahedron  | 12       | 30    | 20    | Water        |
| Dodecahedron | 20       | 30    | 12    | Quintessence |

## The Golden Ratio

Here is a special relationship.

Draw three circles, all the same size, and all in a line, barely touching.

Draw a straight line along one side of the circles, barely touching each one. Start it even with the center of the first circle. End it even with the center of the third and last circle.

Now draw a line through the center of the first circle, at a right angle to the first line, starting at the beginning of the first line, ending at the other side of the first circle.

Now draw a third and final line (to complete a right triangle) from start of the second line to the end of the first line.
