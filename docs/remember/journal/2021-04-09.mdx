## Journal of Kerrbear

And so here we are again.

Summon is underway and going well. We've just closed our first week. I'm contracting for the first month, finally at the rate that I've been seeking, and feeling increasingly actualized with each passing day.

Just now I discovered a wild club of pedants calling themself [the Great Conversation](http://www.greatconversation.com/10-year-reading-plan). They have a 10-year reading plan that looks certifiably exhausting, and yet, someday I may be wrangling my attention span away from some really engrossing VR in order to sit calmly and ingest some of these old tomes. We'll see. Depends on how loud the rest of my life becomes.

Commonplace is pretty well operable and stable. I've got a roadmap of additional features I want, but this is good enough for publishing and sharing notes. Except for the [[two-way-linking]]. I really want that. And I have some leads, just need to follow the white rabbit.

Much of the week has seen me grunting away at this new laptop screen. Summon bought me a same-day delivery golden MacBook Air. Which really put a good taste in my mouth. It's been a while since someone believed in my ability, or even believed what I say. Am I perhaps not yet sunk? Time will tell how buoyant this old boy can be. For now, suffice to say that my fingers are more fleet than ever before. I'll soon be learning Colemak MHk. Those practice sessions will become notes here in the Commonplace, deep in the catacombs of [[forget]], no doubt. I have started using [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) to train up. In QWERTY layout, I have logged 84 words per minute, which is considerably faster than the last time I measured this.

In other small news, I got Neovim running nicely behind VSCode, so the Vim re-education has begun. Also retooled the init for nvim in lua, which is a nice little scripting language. Seems to be used for 2-D game dev, not sure what else. But many of those following the latest Neovim 0.5 release are excited about its native Lua support.

My extensions here in VSCode weigh in at a hefty >$600M value.

Oh and I was reminded of this gem today, the [WordNet made into a dictionary file for Mac OS](https://agiletortoise.com/terminology/mac/).
