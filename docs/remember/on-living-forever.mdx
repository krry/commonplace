# Living Forever

Dear Kevin,

What do you get for the one that wants everyone to know everything?

TL;DR: Agreement. Obedience. Access. Acceptance. An ear. A hand. Your heart. Your time. You give everything. You always have.

When it comes to living forever, you're right. We will. You will. But we will not stay eternally in our current bodies. That would be foolish, something for the Luddites, the Infidels, the Pagans, the Philistines, the Gentiles. Most of us will increasingly download into a collective consciousness from which we can channel our "selves" into control of various semblances of matter. Dump trucks, asteroids, robots, apartment buildings made of hot dog meat, near-light-speed missiles, quanta, eventually whole planets and stars, perhaps galaxies.

We'll chase down all of the matter expanding away from itself and give it purpose and meaning. This is entropy. This is the resolution of static fuzz, of the lack of formation. This is how information resolves.

## The sky isn't falling, it's calling!

An explosion—a Big Bang—propels its shrapnel out in erratic directions. Whether those directions and subsequent collisions are determined by some willful Banger is now beside the point. The trajectory is (all that is) set. Our collective influence soon will compete with that potential predetermining Banger's power. God or no God, we will become God. Unless another sentient strain beats us there.

We might get into a few galactic fights along the way, hard to say. The probability seems high that we're not the end-all-be-all, given how unrefined some of us still are.

But we'll get there. We'll stop fighting over the scarce nearby resources and lean out—we'll appear as herd animals to the cosmos. We'll mine the stars. Get it? "Mine" them? We'll take responsibility for their energy and mass. We'll project our collective will through them. We'll manifest our universe through their fusion.

So stop naming them after your dead pets and focus on _becoming_ the stars!

All that being accepted—and you have no reason not to, because if it happens, it'll happen without you accepting it—_all that being accepted_ it's time to start figuring out what we hold dear, how big we are, who we will augment and propel, and who we would destroy or retard.

Now we begin recognizing our potential, subsuming the ego, seeking oneness, and abandoning the self. (Oxford comma secured.)

Become the shortest string that defines you. Collide with humanity, find your limb, nest in our branches, eat the fruit, grow our leaves.

Back on the ground, let's hope the neckbeards stay on their game. Data losses and power outages in storage facilities can become our new genocides.

The particular enmassings of matter into which we choose to channel our vibrations, our energy, or our spirit will change greatly. Some will choose to occupy tiny particles. some will choose massive bodies. Some of those masses will destroy each other. Others will augment each other.

Is there a record of predictions like this? Do they wipe them from the books? Or is this some new stuff? Ha-ha! Trick question.

## The things you choose to do are good works

You've all heard the stories. Religions are built around crap like this: promises of _eternal bliss_ contingent upon abiding a certain set of moral strictures. Many addictions are built on an impatient pursuit of that same *eternal bliss. Hell, if there are prevalent and voluntary human habits that aren't aimed at the pursuit of eternal bliss, I call them into question *here and now\*.

Justify a single one. Come on, Kevin, regale me. Tell me which religious fanatics or fundamentalists don't believe they're headed for heaven. Tell me which billionaires don't follow an unquestioned moral compass. They may all be knowingly pointed in the wrong directions, and could even expect that they'll be long dead before anyone realizes their misdirection. They dedicate themselves and press on with such a headlong trajectory that others can't help but follow.

The simple truth is that no one of us knows the answer. No one of us knows the meaning of life. But we all do, together. We know that life means survival, consumption, and multiplication. We acknowledge that happiness and loneliness are mutually exclusive. We understand that our clusters of swinging limbs and pulsing arteries and sparking neurons pale in importance to our surroundings. We are the trees, we are the ants, we are the stars. Almost any ethos of note teaches a desire for oneness. Coming together keeps us alive and thriving. Follow the middle way to _moksha_, do your dharma, build your karma, escape samsara, reject the cycle, attain nirvana.

(A brief etymological note, if I may. These words we utter often carry centuries of intended meaning. Sometimes that meaning came with the words. Sometimes it starts with them. Given our one-dimensional sense of time, we have little way of knowing what these words will become. At least we can learn what they once were and propel them as meaningfully as possible. In fact, it strikes me as our duty not to use them without acknowledging their origins. Say what you mean what you know what you mean what you say. Truth is tautology, it's Ouroboros. It eats itself with its mouth, pleonasmically speaking.... Bail or bore on through. I'm going there anyway.)

So ["nirvana" is a negative concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana#Etymology): "don't blow out". Nirvana seems terrifying if it is a place where one cannot exhale. But perhaps transcendence cancels the need for air—our first and dearest human need.

> Don't struggle, don't even bother exhaling. You don't need air anymore. Your most fundamental dependency is moot. You may go. You too shall pass.

And we want to believe in nirvana, or heaven, or moksha. We want to know that something will save us from our struggle. That struggle starts with our first breath. After that we can't give up. We form and practice rituals every week to this effect.

## When did you learn _not_ to hold your breath?

For all its poise and promise, Technology has become a new religion for many. But don't hold your breath. Tech won't save you. Already it's teeming with the blind trappings of religion. **Agile teams scrumming to build lean products.** That sort of crap. Yeah, yeah, we're getting better at this convergence stuff, even as we grow.

To the initiated—to the gentry of the information age—the future is clear. [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil) is our self-appointed Tech Messiah: he's able to predict the future, he knows what will become of us. And we don't want to worry about that, don't want to even try to comprehend it, because it's very fucking hard to process. Our brains heat up, we get tired and frustrated, we argue, we **wage costly wars**. So instead we read and we listen, we form squads and cliques around **_his_ future**, mainly because we don't allow ourselves to create it instead. Lots of royal "we"s in there. _This is what I do. This is what I project on many of you_.

## Olly olly oxen free!

Now for a brief sidestep. I've been diving into Paul Lansky's music tonight, following the resonance of Imogen Heap's "Hide and Seek" with his recording of [a vocal poem called "Her Song"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Wezy9RlC8u1QUP9ViBvq9) which was [inspired by a poem by Thomas Campion](http://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/liner_notes/fantasies.html). Then deep in Lansky's catalog I hear the melody from Tom's Diner by Suzanne Vega in an étude/parody he calls "Been Here Before". Vega's 1981 song found its way to the masses as [a remix by DNA in 1990, a cassette single of which](https://open.spotify.com/track/7f9sC9fvtjYSZYOLSmKJlq) my father frugally bought for his daily commutes in a red Geo Storm when I was a wee lad. I vaguely remember searching the record store for it. We may have karaoked it to the staff:

`"Dut dut *duh* duh, dut duh *DUH* duh"`.

It's a very familiar song, a lullaby of nostalgia—a painful memory of joy. Weeks back Josh poured Imogen into my head as ketamine dissolved us into the floor. She has been echoing within me ever since: "Mmm whatcha say?" Lansky drew from Vega, then inspired Heap. Out of time, two _a capella_ vocal themes had found me through a conduit in Lansky. Guess I have a type.

> "There's a woman on the outside looking inside—does she see me? No, she does not really see me cuz she sees her own reflection. And I'm trying not to notice that she's hitching up her skirt and while she's straightening her stockings, her hair has gotten wet."

`Dut dut *duh* duh, dut duh *DUH* duh`.

So meaningless, I thought as a boy. Nonsense. Some lady droning on about an uneventful few moments at a shitty diner. Something about the same-old-same-old, the humdrum, the doldrum, set over some R&B drums, some [good vibes from Soul II Soul: "Keep on movin', don't stop, no!"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4NMtuxWfOPR6yNjAX0AWrR).

Smells like _nirvana_. **Don't blow out!** "Keep on movin', don't stop, no!"
