# Stinky Startled Ants

Have you ever smelled a frightened ant?

I have recently been inundated with technophilic ants. Granted I may, from time to time, use my electronics as tables, bowls, plates and trays. Crumbs have fallen, but I am no slob. Who among us doesn't have a little cheese in the mouse ball?

Oh yeah? You don't, huh. Well, go count spider webs or something. Go streak-free the tiniest window on your car for two hours.

Back to the ants; these crave notfood. They appear in the crossword book in my bathroom, sleeping. I find these puzzles stimulating. Ants do not apparently, even while they poop. Time to shelve the crossword books outside the bathroom.

Just now, an ant tweedles onto the palmrest of my laptop. Flips antenna left. Senses nothing there. Antennae twirl. Nothing here. It seems drawn to the warmth put out by the little white tablet. As though the ant sees the computer as a living thing. As though it expects to find nourishment or safety there.

I have seen so many ants crawling on the keys and palmrests of my laptop that I now suspect a colony may have been established within. I imagine this would be a rather insular colony, if not some form of sub-colony as I do not think a laptop is any place to raise an ant family, certainly not fit for a queen. Perhaps it is merely an outpost or a prospective farm. The toasty little integrated circuitboards would be a nice place to warm one's exoskeleton amidst the arduous trek from colony to cultivar.

The OED (Oxford English Dictionary) lists the word 'emmet' as an archaic form of 'ant', both derived from the same Old English root. If I were compelled to keep a pet ant, its name would be Dr. Emmet Brown, and I hope it would build me a flux capacitor. I'll work on getting the weapons-grade plutonium from the Libyans. But that's all beside the stinking point.

The rotten reality of the situation is that ants freak out and squirt some odiferous potion when they are surprised. And they seem to be surprised each and every time I reach out to help them away from my Open-Apple key or the crevasse del spacebar. Their yikes juice is noxious, extremely repellant, and violently murderous to the appetite. I can imagine a faddish diet plan centered around affixing a live ant near one's nose or the corner of the mouth. The ant would shit itself whenever its host attempted to eat. The smell—or, God forbid, the taste—would curb the hosts appetite with the resolve of a train wreck. Starvation guaranteed or your money back.

Moral of the story: if you answered "no" to the original question of this entry, keep it that way. I am periodically haunted with the residual memory of the odor at various inopportune times. The way a former lover's perfume can haunt you, only the ant is by no means a lover, but a tiny and supremely effective nauseator. Distilled down into its essential oil form, it would be the Essence of Vurp.
