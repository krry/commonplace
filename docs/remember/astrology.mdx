# Astrology

Astrologers look to the stars for information about the character of individual terrestrials.

- üåû The Sun rises and sets once a day, so the constellation in which it rose on the day you were born is thought to explain your daily countenance. Imagining the Sun as a conscious observer in the quantum sense yields a momentary, but perhaps timeless perspective on the realm of possibilities into which you were born. Imagine the Sun taking a quantum snapshot with a galactic camera from perspective at the moment of your birth. With perfect vision, the Sun could witness its rays bouncing off your newborn skin some eight minutes after you came into the world. At that moment it could glimpse all the possibilities that will come within your grasp on a daily basis.

- üåù The Moon has a much closer vantage, but cycles around us more slowly, every 28 days or so. The Moon, as a conscious observer from its lunar perspective, might glimpse the possibilities that will arise for you on a more monthly basis.
- ‚òø Mercury has a three-month cycle relative to the Sun from Earth, so it might understand how your possibilities change from season to season.
- ‚ôÄ Venus' cycles every eight months, eighteen and two-thirds days, nearly as long as a human gestation period. Earth of course has a yearly cycle.
- ‚ö¶ Mars cycles every two years, which is the time we allot to learn many skills such as martial arts or professional fields of study.
- ‚ôÉ Jupiter's twelve year cycle reflects the length of a phase of human life from childhood, to adolescence, to young adulthood, adulthood, middle age, old age, and senescence. Seven cycles of Jupiter is eighty-four years, which is roughly the average length of a human life.
- ü™ê Saturn cycle is more than twice as long: 29 years, around the span of a generation of humanity.
- ‚ôÖ Uranus takes 84 years to cycle: one human life, or three generations.
- ‚ôÜ Neptune returns to where it started 165 years after your birth, observing your whole life and the entire lives of your grandchildren, sometimes the lifespan of a nation state.
- ‚ôá Pluto, in its 248 cycle, observes whole revolutions of human culture. The Industrial Revolution was just beginning about that long ago.

This line of inquiry asks a lot from you. Prolong your disbelief with open-minded skepticism. Ask whether the star chart an astrologer draws for you contains insights from these planets' different perspectives about the possibilities you encounter. If your Moon was in Aries, do you find yourself itching for a passionate new adventure every month or so? If Mercury was in Pisces, do you emotions swing with the seasons? More generally, if you and everyone you know and don't know and every living thing on Earth that has attention and intention to direct outward or inward is conscious, could the planets themselves be conscious? Their consciousness might provide far more profound advances in the quality of consciousness than our meek exercises in free will might.
