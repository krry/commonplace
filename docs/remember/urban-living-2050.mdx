# Urban living, Earth, 2050

There are less types of organisms in city limits than there used to be. Most of them are shades of grey and brown, some nighttime black. They blend in and together.

The animals that can choose their makeup do so. Humans have a global variety of hairstyles in any city. Blondes, brunettes, ravens, auburns, gingers span the globe and the panoply of remaining "races". Of course, by 2050, few races remain. Only the most isolated communities of humans have failed to mix with the greater pool. But most of us have blended, our features vary naturally considerably less than they did thirty-five years ago.

Left to our genetic dispositions, we have melanin-infused skin, brown hair, brown eyes. Our faces have strong chins, wide eyes, streamlined noses, high cheekbones. Our hands fall a palm below our butts. Our shoulders are narrow; elevators give us no need to climb. Our legs are thin and long, our chests small, our bellies big. Our cranial capacity and hip width have tracked each other and plateaued.

We now have a new alphabet of animals. There are only twenty or forty of them to learn after all, and children must learn them much better to survive since they encounter them daily rather than rarely. E for Elephant holds no value to the urban dweller, never has, but now more than 75% of the Earth's human population live in cities.

It struck me before this endeavor that an alphabet is not the prime tool with which to teach the next generation of the core concepts of life. My embarrassing efforts in learning Mandarin, and the Japanese Kanji, have exposed that we have many more useful symbols that lack innate syllables or phonics. I still have not enough time, no matter how much I consume or burn.
