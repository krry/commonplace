# README for teh codez

If you have stepped away for a while, you may, as I currently find myself,
find yourself rusty and lost as to how to steer this Goldbergian contraption.

Here are the basics for this setup.

## Mac Setup

- the ctrl key does `<esc>`
- the caps lock key does `<ctrl>`
- your dotfiles are in `~/.dot`

## Fish Shell

- to open your dotfiles, try `dotv`
- to configure fish, `confish`
- to see fish functions, `functions`

## Shell aliases

- `devmo` takes you to the dev dir
- `atma` jumps to atmanaut.me dir
- `chak` jumps within that to the chakra theme dir
- `dot` takes you to your dotfiles

## Utilities you Know and Love

- `rg` ripgrep offers very fast file and dir searching
- `fd` can scour file contents like lightning

## Nvim Editor

- `<leader>ec` gets you to your init.vim or vimrc
- your leader key in vim is `<space>`
- `h/j/k/l` navigate like arrows
- `<C-f>` page down, or `<C-b>` to page up
- to close buffers, windows, tabs, `<C-q>`
- to find a string within a buffer, `/`

### Help in Vim

- `:h <query>` for help on "query"
- `<C-]>` to jump to a cursored links

### File nav

- `gf` to go to the file the cursor is on
- `<C-o>` to jump to the previous file in the buffer
- hit `-` to open the filetree
- use `/` to start a search within the buffer
- `<space>f` to denite fuzzy search in filesystem
- `s` to highlight all instances of a string

### Modes

- hit `i` to enter insert mode where you can type
  - vim-surround can change the surrounds
- hit `v` to enter visual mode, where you can select text

### Wiki

- open wiki with `<space>ww`

VIM Text Objects review:
_ `e` jumps to end of word, `p` paragraph, `w` by word, `l` by line
_ `o` means outside the group, `i` is inside
