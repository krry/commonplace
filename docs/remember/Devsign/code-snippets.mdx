# Code Snippets I Have Known and Lost

Today I was reminded how complicated it is to [[test-for-an-empty-object-in-javascript]].
And tonight I learned how to [[filter-undefined-nodes-out-of-an-array]].

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[test-for-an-empty-object-in-javascript]: test-for-an-empty-object-in-javascript "Test For An Empty Object In Javascript"
[filter-undefined-nodes-out-of-an-array]: filter-undefined-nodes-out-of-an-array "Filter Falsy Nodes Out Of An Array"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
