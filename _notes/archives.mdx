Gradually I'll be pulling in my old Roam graph, which wasn't enormous, but who has time?

- [[1-02-time-is-the-currency]]
- [[make-space-+-waste-time-=-find-yrself]]
- [[a-dusty-rumination-on-time]]

Here we keep notes that were once in [[projects]], [[areas]], or [[resources]] and may someday be of value again. The fourth tier of [[para]], we let these get dusty.
