# Intend

In the [[fair-method]] method, we organize our energy primarily by [[intention]].

## From Hot to Cold

- [[commonplace]]
  this silly sacred space
- [[nameless]]
  a friendly yijing oracle on the web
- [[easeness]]
  a way to be doing and do being
- [[the-well-of-being]]
  stories from the loving void
- [[this-is-it]]
  satori, tathata, and other epiphanies
- [[atman]]
  following awareness from being to being

Previously I called these projects (the P in Tiago's [[para-method]]). They remain the more teleological endeavors, ones with an end in sight. But they are now framed for [[easeness]], without a business mind. The dustier ones I try to [[forget]].
