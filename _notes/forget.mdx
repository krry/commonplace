# Forget

As the first step in [[fair]], I celebrate the demise of these passing thoughts by throwing them into the wind.

Gradually I've been unearthing old stuff from my old Roam graph, which wasn't enormous, but who has time?

- [[1-02-time-is-the-currency]]
- [[make-space-+-waste-time-=-find-yrself]]
- [[a-dusty-rumination-on-time]]
- [[poetry]]

Previously I called these the Archives, where one would keep notes that were once in projects, areas, or resources and may someday be of value again. As the fourth tier of [[para-method]], we let these get dusty.
