title: Time Machines
---
# Time Machines- The question isn't whether we will ever invent a time machine,
  - or whether reality would cascade into paradoxical chaos with its inception
    - but rather
  - do we have any need to do this outside of our minds
    - which have been time machines the whole time
      - we've been wondering about time machines
        - and many millennia before that.
