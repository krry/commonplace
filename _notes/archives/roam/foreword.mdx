# Forewords

This is for the family, friends, and creatures who reflect the quality of my consciousness, and the love we share.

I intend to share the truth I find with anyone who seeks it. I will keep this account short and sweet. There is no time to waste, only quality to raise.

I will call on the truths of Tom Campbell (*My Big TOE*), Joseph Campbell (*The Hero with a Thousand Faces*), Yuval Noah Harari (*Sapiens* and *Homo Deus*), Robert M. Pirsig (*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*), Douglas R. Hofstadler (*GÃ¶del Escher Bach*), Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking (*A Brief History of Time*), Rupert Sheldrake (*The Science Delusion*), and many other minds.
