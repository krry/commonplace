# PARA

Developed by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/), PARA is a system of organization or a methodology for tending one's second brain, zettelkasten, or digital garden.

## Projects | Areas | Resources | Archives

- [[projects]]
  - a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline
- [[areas]]
  - a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time
- [[resources]]
  - a topic or theme of ongoing interest
- [[archive]]
  - inactive items from the other three categories.

## Speculation

Whether this is an example of an [associative ontology](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z29hLZHiVt7W2uss2uMpSZquAX5T6vaeSF6Cy) that emerged to Tiago, or a hierarchical taxonomy that will restrict me unwarrantedly remains to be seen.

## Evaluation

- quite business, work, and productivity oriented
- I'm giving it the old college try at least through today [[2021-03-19]]
- so far I'm displeased with the system, but want to stabilize the app before I throw it back into upheaval

## Evolution

- want to adjust PARA toward more creativity and less productivity

### Projects become Intend

- Projects need a goal but not a deadline, the goal has a desired span
  - we'll just call them by the core action: Intend
  - intentions have a context and an impact

### Areas and Resources become Attend

- Areas are close to okay but needn't be maintained, just enjoyed
  - we'll call them by the core action: Attend
  - attention covers a field
  - the context of an intention is also a field
- Resources are effectively identical to Areas, only separate in Tiago's system according to the obedient boundary between have-to and want-to.

  - could forgo a separate categories for fields we enjoy and fields we don't, since we won't be attending any fields we don't enjoy

### Archives become Reflect

- Projects, Areas, and Resources that aren't serving me to pursue can be cordoned off
- this might be rare. I don't know if this is useful yet.
