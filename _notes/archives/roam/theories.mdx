## [New Mysterianism](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/New_mysterianism)
Comprehension of consciousness is (and may remain) out of reach for the human mind. Old mysterians were dualists who denied that consciousness could be explained scientifically because it operates on unnatural principles and possesses unnatural properties. Colin McGinn is the leading proponent of mysterianism.

Some philosophers, like William James and Thomas Campbell, take comfort (and counsel us to join them) in accepting that they cannot know everything.

Mumbo-jumbo, according to most who consider quantum effects on consciousness.
