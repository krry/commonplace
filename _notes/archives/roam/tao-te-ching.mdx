# Tao Te Ching

Notably the "Ching" here is identical to that in "I Ching". So it's really more of a `jīng` as in [[yijing]], high tone, meaning "classic book".

"The way you can go
isn't the real way.
The name you can say
isn't the real name."
— [[Tao Te Ching #1]]
as interpreted by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
