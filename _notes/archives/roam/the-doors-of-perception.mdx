- We filter our sensations through layers of [fears]([[fear]]), [desires]([[want]]), [expectations]([[expectation]]), [emotions]([[emotion]]), [beliefs]([[belief]]), [delusions]([[delusion]]), and [illusion]([[Maya]]).
    - We ultimately interpret our perceptions with our knowledge, understanding, previous experience, and wisdom as we climb [[The Learning Ladder]].
    - We use logic to justify our actions, attitudes, feelings, and beliefs to reinforce our ego and its defense systems with our powers of [[intellect]].
        - We protect and shield ourselves from our fears with wants, desires, and expectations that fuel and stuff our egos with purpose.
