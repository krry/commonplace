# Yen

If we, beings sharing consciousness, accept that consciousness exists and that everything we experience either is Œ or a construct of Œ, we may next want to know what Œ wants, or what drives Œ to attend and intend and manifest. Œ likely has a multitude of motivations, but one must be the prime yen.

As we have discussed, [pure consciousness](/Consciousness.md) has two abilities: attention and intent. Attention—noticing, observing, listening, caring, organizing, guiding—breeds awareness. Likewise intent—meaning, aspiring, envisioning, designing, proposing, planning—breeds purpose. Consciousness is a calico cat-skin quilt of awareness with purpose, purposed attention, attentive intent, intentional awareness, aware intention, purposed awareness, porpoise-full no-hairness, 

From our perspective, consciousness is everything and only one thing, or Only Everything (Œ). Œ in its pure form has no size or shape, no weight or density, no matter or energy, no force or inertia, no charge, just potential. Œ may have [entropy](/Entropy.md). [Without knowing Œ's origin](/Origin.md), understanding **why** Œ intends to manifest what it does may only be possible via reverse engineering.

Œ expresses its intent in every facet of the (virtual) realities it constructs. We, conscious beings, can notice its intent with inward or outward attention.
