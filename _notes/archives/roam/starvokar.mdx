# Starvokar- Where did the Starvokans come from? When did they arrive on Earth?
    - Questions like these are hard to answer in any way that would satisfy your average terrestrian.
    - A Vokan sometimes appears as an aphid, at other moments as a comet or a distant galaxy, or merely a twist in the breeze.
    - For two thousand millennia (2,000,000 years) before the last Earthwide flood and the great ice age that preceded it, the Vokans made a habit of strolling blissfully through the great forests of Earth, leading the birds and bugs in song. They would flip through the seas singing with the whales, dance with the dolphins, dive with the squid.
- The Vokans know their place, their part in the song, their steps in the dance. So, like the birds just before dawn, they sing with confidence and gratitude, leading the chorus mightily.
    - ### A Vokan has no doubts between strides.
- In truth, we are Vokans too, thought we do not remember ourself. We can, if we choose to, perceive as the Vokans do. Already we too sit, feel, think, and move in ten dimensions of space and time.
