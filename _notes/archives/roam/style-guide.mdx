- Attention is drawn to the unfamiliar and the unknown
- This story will resemble and reference many and all others, so please ramble on until a bear—docile and dancing—emerges to complete the thought which, without the bear, might have left us grasping for a point.
- Alternating tones from heavy to light, playful to serious, swinging on the pendulum.
- May this be experience crafted by my deepest, truest intentions and directed by yours.
