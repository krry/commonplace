# Gaia

- Is it plausible that:
  - if a plant can learn to evade harm as the Datura does
  - if a fungus like cordyceps can zombify an art and steer it up a tree
  - then couldn't it be that our planet too is paying attention and forming intent?
- The planet, after all, is far more massive, far older, hosts vastly more electricity and magnetism, experiences incredible flows of resources, expansions, contractions, vibrations, sensations than any widely accepted life-form upon it.
  - Perhaps there are beings, nodes of awareness, much larger and more ancient than the forms of cellular life we hold dear and anthropocentrically revere.
- Seismic events, though slow to develop, are impulsive and unpredictable.
- Our earthly weather is a turbulent system of charge and moisture of immense complexity far beyond that of the neocortex of a human, yet still subject to the chaotic influence of small-scale effects that can snowball and amplify into tremendous climate events.
