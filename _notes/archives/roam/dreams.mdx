# Dreams

As Campbell describes revisiting unactualized past reality state vectors in NPMR~N~, I am reminded of many of my dreams, where some of the people I know are there, and others whom I know but cannot identify from PMR, play integral roles in a familiar but strange narrative I am living out. The story is new, some of the characters the same, odd settings, rules shifted or altered.
