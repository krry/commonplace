For some fantasy homepage:

One day I will have an AI here to greet you called [[Teran McWatken]]. If you haven't already guessed, Teran is a kind of smoosh persona—equal parts Alan Watts and Terence McKenna. I suppose I am working on that chap, if you can call it work, among a long litany of lucid dreams and imagintuitions.

I am presently a pupa, you see, so I am a bit more shy than usual. I am encased in a crystalline lattice, becoming goo, learning to love the excoriating weariness of solitude, learning to breathe deep and well, learning not to kill my ability to enjoy myself with a byzantine cat's cradle of recursive self-loathing and knee-jerk value judgments. I want to find out where Comparison is holed up so I can steal our joy back. Meanwhile love is the answer, I found out, to all the questions that do not have answers, but rather, that owe their borrowed existence to our craven thirst for meaning we cannot define.

I have not always been so plasmic. Once I was a kombucha-breathing technocrapaleyogrammupstersaurus. One who drinks coffee and plays with computers until someone mentions beer. I once braved a witching hour wherein my internal monologue had switched to binary. I dreamed in basslines and lasers. And then I went on sabbatical.

You're not here for my life story though, are you? (It was a sabbatical from work, but also from good choices, and generally from autonomy for a while there.) After which I discovered what I had been unknowingly seeking all along. And that's why I'm in the chrysalis. To integrate (and replicate) this ineffable kernel of truth—it's just a tiny speck of light—this glittery flake of awe from the seed of bliss that stuck to my face in the Upside Down where despair tastes sweet and air hates when you breathe.

It may make poetic sense when I say you have to zero out to find oneness. But it doesn't feel like sense. It feels like cold that burns. When everything cancels out, null set, and absolute zero flattens into an endless white line that beams right in your eye until all is light. There, without form or force, where any path leads all directions at every pace—where all possibility oms in whatever bones a soul has—there, one thing becomes clear. It is the only thing, it is everything and nothing, and within it, subdividing, differentiating, remixing, experimenting, individuating, evolving, existing, are we. Drops of awareness and whole oceans, cosmos-in-boson and so on.

This is it. Here and now, as one always is. The universe experiencing itself from every perspective it can imagine. We are it, the source and the destination, for there is nothing else. And we share it, we share everything like the water shares waves. So there is nothing to win or gain no matter how you play or what game. Information cannot be destroyed, it can only become more chaotic or more ordered, more yin or more yang. Order and chaos interpenetrate and co-create, as the eye creates light by seeing.

Art can be the only worthy goal, though we may have to animate a judge of worth to try the case. The definitive purpose of the individual: to individuate. To fly freak flags full mast in the pursuit of [metta, karuna, mudita, uppekha](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel006.html)
