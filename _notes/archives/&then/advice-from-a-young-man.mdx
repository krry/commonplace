# Advice from a seemingly young, arguably wise man

### Lessons you should have learned from being an animal
1. Don't apologize for the mess.

Live how you will live, and impose upon your guests to understand that you do.

2. If worries or fears repeat themselves, interrupt them. 

Take a worry, find its worst-case-scenario, and imagine it as vividly as you can. Then understand how unlikely that outcome is. Quit worrying.

Take a fear, find its gritty essence, and imagine that as vividly as you can. Then understand how much realer your life's other dangers are. Quell your fear.

3. Squirt

It feels good. Plus, the world will squirt on you even if you don't squirt on it. So squirt on it.

However... don't squirt just because you can. Save it up until it's concentrated.

4. Fart.

A corollary to squirt. Be honest with your environment. Life is too short to spend holding farts.

5. Fuck!

Your body will drive you to do others for most of your young life. Find a way to do this healthily. It feels really good, and it will strengthen all parties involved if you do it right.

6. Use the evolutionary mirror

The next time you find yourself wondering why you had such a reaction to something, or why someone else reacted the way they did, understand this: you exist because your ancestor responded correctly. This should not place any additional pressure on your decision. Rather the added perspective should help to lighten the mood.  You're good.  You're solid.

7. Men are from (rhymes with Mars), women are from (rhymes with Venus).

Wouldn't it be nice if our differences between genders were less than those between beasts? Historically it's a wide chasm to bridge, but we needn't bring astronomy into the mix to solve this disturbance in the force.

The unfortunate point is that sexual reproduction is rooted in dominance.
