# Branciforte

#### Given that this will be a new home base, weâ€™re curious how you envision creating/expanding community and what your expectation of visitors would be?

We can be a beacon of peace in the slowing times. Our community comprises the art we need to heal. We are only two who see this, and yet we are all who need to. Our visitors will be those who can assist in assembling the calm. They are few and potent. The land can blossom absurdly. The barn can teem with organic wealth at the pace we accept.

We try to be the field we want to play in. Home radiates from heart center, which is conspicuously everywhere as we attend to the delicate awareness of being within and around us. Visitors receive the same welcome we offer ourself, so we expect for anyone the hospitality we feel for the tender spirit wading in the pond around well of being.

Community at present is a nebula of souls once met in raw, needless love. Community to come involves first those with radiant courage, then those who absorb and relay tidings of our collective cultural matriculation from baby warmongers to teenage shepherd haberdashers.

Simply put, we have a kernel of love between us that needs no fuel. Many vessels may pass the cove, noticing or unawares. We tilt the mirrors of chance toward those who camouflage within the incandescent shimmer of sunset on sea.
