## About Us

We are authors, devsigners, entreflaneurs, water spiders, generalists dedicated to unfolding the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.

Evolution is a conscious process whereby life improves. What we call technology are the artifacts we manifest during this process. Examples of excellent heart-first technology include humility, self-sovereignty, words of affirmation and consent, love poems, odes, elegies, eulogies, hugs, hammocks, gardens, permaculture, the brahmavihārās (the four divine abodes).

The Law of Return dictates that all that comes into being eventually returns to center.

Technology is an evolved extension of our natural abilities.
Nature is the void from which life springs.

## Intention/Purpose

We here to play courageously in service to all beings.

As one who knows it's not serious,
I am here to serve the world
through courage and play.

  - Learning Mandarin as an adult is no small feat. At the very least it can be entertaining. We did our best to bring an effective, engaging Mandarin language-learning platform to the West.

- Arrivo
  - "Don't let Earth suck" sang the gargantuan neon sign at HQ. We assembled all-stars and avengers to put an end to traffic. The world might not be ready for a hyperloop, but aren't we ready to arrive?
  - It was a blessing and a joy to think so big. To inform our ambitions, I created a comprehensive timeline of transportation technology. I also got to set up the IT infrastructure
