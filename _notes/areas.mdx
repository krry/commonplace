# Areas

- [[get-real]]
- [[full-smile]]
- [[atmanaut]]
- [[sovereignty]]
- [[poetry]]
- And even some half-baked stories, like:
  - [Ä€tman](areas/stories/atman)
  - [[chapter-1-flying]]
  - [[clotho-rewoven]]
  - [[sissy-no-fuss-ep-1]]

Here we keep notes about my areas of responsibility and pointed interest, especially those that don't fit within one of the [[projects]] at the moment. The second tier of [[para]], these are important but not time-sensitive pursuits.
