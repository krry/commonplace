# Krry in a Nutshell

Here's my cards. I didn't come to play poker.

I'm came to build, grow, improve, disrupt, and help others win at life.

- I thrive under intrinsic pressure. If I believe it should be, I will do everything to make it happen.
- I want us to live sustainably. And I hope the US is best situated to lead that charge.
- I've been in an unfortunate state of debt since law school.
- I have 100 unfinished essays weighing on my creative conscience.
- I am passionate about:
  - fostering a healthy culture among those that build tech
  - conveying more of the value of information technology to everyone

Why I need a change?

- I work better at night
- I work better outside the office
- I'm tired of trying to solve the same problem over and over.
