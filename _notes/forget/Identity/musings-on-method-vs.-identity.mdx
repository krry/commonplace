# Musings On Method Vs. Identity

Identity and Method: Where is the dividing line?

"I cannot run from battle. I cannot run from what I am." - John Lee, as played by Chow Yun Fat, in Replacement Killers

Here the gunslinging assassin defines himself by his past actions. Had he chosen his ambitions as identity fodder, he would have said, "I cannot run from an opportunity to achieve salvation for innocent people in danger of wrongful death at the hands of vengeful Chinese crimelords."

At this juncture, I hope to align my identity by my ambitions, not my deeds. I imagine that preference will invert at some point in mid-life, but I hope that day is still distant.
