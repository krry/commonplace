# Spiritual Energy

## Prana

- the breath animate us
- connects the body with the mind
- aliveness, flowing through you

## Chakras

- energy centers
- can open and fill with light one by one

## Qi

- harness the flow
- finds seats in the body: higher and lower dantian

## Kundalini

- power of creation waking up inside
- can be terrifying
