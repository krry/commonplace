# Forewords

This is for the family, friends, and creatures who reflect the quality of my consciousness, and the love we share.

I intend to share the truth I find with anyone who seeks it. I will keep this account short and sweet. There is no time to waste, only quality to raise.

I will call on the truths of Tom Campbell (_My Big TOE_), Joseph Campbell (_The Hero with a Thousand Faces_), Yuval Noah Harari (_Sapiens_ and _Homo Deus_), Robert M. Pirsig (_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_), Douglas R. Hofstadler (_GÃ¶del Escher Bach_), Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking (_A Brief History of Time_), Rupert Sheldrake (_The Science Delusion_), and many other minds.
