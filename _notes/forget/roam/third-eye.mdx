# Third Eye

The pineal gland could be the gateway between the physical and non-physical realms.
- This small organ, the size of a grain of rice, shaped like a pinecone, starts as a bud in the palate of a fetus and migrates into the center of the brain.
- At day 49 in the gestation of a human being, it finds its seat there at the center. Day 49 is also the typical point at which the gender of a fetus can be detected. The Tibetan Book of the Dead tells us that it takes 49 days for a soul to become untethered from its last host.
- The pineal gland holds the highest concentration of serotonin in the human body.
- The pineal gland produces DMT in humans and in rats.
- The Egyptians diagram the brain with the Eye of Horus, placing the pineal gland and/or thalamus at the pupil of that diagram.
- The pineal gland controls the release of melatonin in the brain.

For millennia we have spouted hypotheses about the true purpose of the pineal gland. Today the memesters, conspiracy paranoics, and lunatics that scurry down the shadowy alleys of the World Wide Web can howl at the moon (and in this case the Sun) together across time and space. Descartes cast it as the seat of the soul, channelling the Egyptian interpretation perhaps unknowingly. Lunatics and mystics notwithstanding, our neuroscientists have developed a more empirical, albeit limited, understanding of the structure and functions of the pineal gland.

Thanks to our more gruesome physicians, we know that the human pineal gland lies near the very center of the brain, a grain of rice shaped like a pinecone branching off of the hypothalamus, nestled safely in the darkest recesses of the cranium. In certain animal species (notably lizards) and at certain developmental phases, the pineal gland resembles a third eye, sometimes complete with an eyelid of its own. In birds (and perhaps other animals), the pineal gland contains magnetic material with which they can orient on and navigate the Earth. In a human fetus, it begins as a bud in the oral palate, and slowly migrates to its cranio-central throne by the 49th day of gestation. Coincidentally [it is not until the seventh week of pregnancy](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/health/10birth.html) that we have been able to reliably detect the gender of a baby. For some Buddhists, especially those following the Bardo Thodol (The Tibetan Book of the Dead), the intermediate state between death and rebirth, known as *[Bardo](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bardo)*, lasts "seven times seven days". I will leave you to draw whatever tenuous links you would like. For my money, I expect that with careful attention and open minds, we can follow the pineal gland into a more fertile realm of understanding of the mind-body connection, of the non-physical origins of our physical manifestation.

For something so reclusive and diminutive, with the delicacy and intricacy of a snowflake, this little speck of brain has a profound relationship with our mood swings, our headspace, and our fundamental states of consciousness. In the pineal gland we find the highest concentration of serotonin, the neurotransmitter that most strongly correlates with feelings of well-being. The pineal gland also produces DMT (dimethyltryptamine), known in some circles as the God Molecule. DMT is the lowest common molecular denominator among many of the profoundly psychedelic compounds we have discovered, notably psilocybin, psilocin, and lysergic acid diethylamide, which masquerade as serotonin, bonding to the brain's serotonin receptors for significantly longer than serotonin can remain bonded, stimulating these heart-opening pathways and bringing marvel to the psyche. 

The lead physician in the 411-day fasting experiment of Hira Ratan Manek, [Dr. Sudhir Shah](mailto:sudhirshah@hotmail.com), describes the remarkable photosensitivity and responsiveness of the pineal gland. The pineal gland also regulates the release of melatonin in the brain in response to the cycles of light and dark detected by our retinas. Melatonin is the Sandman, the weight on our eyelids, the looming squall of what dreams may come. The waking mind is a helium balloon pulling at the top of a net in the grips of the flesh. Melatonin dissolves the net.

Visible light represents a narrow band of frequencies somewhere in what we perceive as the middle of the broad, perhaps infinite, spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. The reddest light, which has the lowest energy, vibrates 430 trillion times a second, while the highest energy violet light wiggles about half as fast at 770 THz, corresponding to a tiny range of wavelengths from 700 nanometers for the reddest of the reds down to nearly half as long at 390 nanometers for the not-quite-ultra violet. By comparison, infrared waves, some of which we sense as radiant heat, span from 700 nanometers to 1 millimeter in wavelength, so the longest infrared waves are more than a million times longer than the shortest ones, which are in turn a million times more energetic than the longest infrared waves. The microwaves that pop our popcorn have a frequency of 2.45 GHz with a wavelength around 12 centimeters (about 5 inches), more than a thousand times less energetic than light. Cell phones send and receive signals between 1.85 and 1.99 GHz. Our Wi-Fi networks operate at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. This is all to say that our retinas, which detect tiny nuances in visible light, are **extremely** sensitive, but nowhere near as sensitive as our electronic doohickeys. A Wi-Fi router emits radiation only 2% less energetic than a microwave oven, but one delivers [a YouTube video of an iPhone bursting into flames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6VyWex3Gag&t=253s) to your iPhone while the other incinerates your iPhone.

So the retina picks up the presence and character of visible light that penetrates it, converting what it detects into electrical signals that travel along the optic nerve to the occipital lobe where they are processed as visual data, and that also travel along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, where they continue along the pineal nerve to the pineal gland. When the retinas stop sensing visible light and stop sending these impulses to the pineal gland, the pineal gland releases melatonin, and we get sleepy. I wonder, like Dr. Shah did with HRM, what happens in the opposite case.

As our retinas are bombarded and penetrated by more and more photons, as we receive the energy of visible light, the highest frequency radiation that can reach us through the Earth's atmosphere, and as that energy is channeled through our nervous system, what can occur? How can our bodies harness that energy? How much of that energy can they harness before we incur damage?

Who among us has not been warned against staring at the sun? You'll go blind! Have you tried it anyway? Have you stood at dawn or at dusk gazing at the edge of the horizon, sipping on the first or the last rays of the day? Have you held a staring contest with the Sun and won, as many of us did during the total solar eclipse over North America on the 21st of August in 2017? I have. I am not blind. And while my optometrist says the tiny floaters, the calcifications of vitreous humor that swim in my visual field, are more likely due to age or errant lasers than sungazing, I cannot endorse or recommend you to gaze at anything that brings you harm under the belief that it may heal you.

The so-called [Breatharians](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Inedia), the sungazers, and the [Ormus-drinkers](https://primalhacker.com/blog/ormus-and-sungazing) may claim that the sun can provide the energy their bodies need, that the prana sustains them. It is well established that no human being can maintain consciousness without breathing, [at least for more than 24ish minutes](https://www.wired.com/story/what-it-takes-to-hold-your-breath-for-24-minutes-yeah-its-a-thing/). But being able to subsist without food or water, nourished only by light and air, remains a dubious, unverified, and remote possibility. Rather than analyze the veracity of the breatharians' claims, my focus is keen on the commonly demonstrated relationships between light, breath, and health.

The pineal gland is the commander of the endocrine system, beating the circadian drum as we rise and fall with the Sun, pumping out hormones that make teens horny and elders age, inhibiting (or not) metastasis and tumor growth, stimulating (or not) the immune system in response to threats or invaders, producing serotonin when the light is bright, and converting it into melatonin when it grows dark. Serotonin, one might say, is not all some *body* needs to survive and thrive. We need love and acceptance and connectedness and interaction, but does a body? We need air to breathe to tether the mind to the flesh (this is prana). The flesh chiefly consists of water (99% of its molecules are in fact H~2~O), so it may need water. And the flesh needs some source of energy, which at various times is warmth or light or food, to allow the mind to channel the breath to animate the body according to our will or our intent.
