# A Timely Pretirement

I **_pretired_** on 7 December 2015. I quit my job, sold my stuff, gave up my apartment, left San Francisco, and hit the road. Logistically speaking it had only taken me a few weeks to shed the trappings of my stationary life, but it had taken me much, much longer to prepare myself psychologically and spiritually for this transition. Once I was ready to untether, it all happened so fast. A month later the impact of this drastic lifestyle change is still sinking in. Every morning I arise smiling and erect. My smile deepens with every passing day as I blink the sleep out of my eyes and remind myself what I'm up to, what I'm free from, and where I'm going: **anywhere**.

## No work and all play

Employment was the first and toughest tether to sever. Over the last three years I had poured the plurality of my time and energy into SolarCity; I had spent countless hours building their products, their culture, and their team. So rather than cut that tether, I found myself carefully loosening the knots, untying them, then disentangling myself. I handed off my duties to responsible inheritors. I worked feverishly to complete the cutting-edge [`gulp`](gulpjs.com) build system I had promised to deliver. I pulled colleagues aside one by one to vet my crazy idea and to give them some time to understand that I was leaving.

Everyone was very supportive, if a bit bewildered. They had plenty of questions, the answering of which helped me develop and hone my concept of this new nomadic lifestyle. Many expressed good-natured envy, which I gently deflected: "Anyone can do this. It's a choice we all have."

This may seem pithy or flippant, but I hold to it. I do not claim that everyone will enjoy life on the road, or that they will survive for very long. I don't claim that life on the road will be comfortable or easy. Just that we can—each of us—choose to travel or to stay put. We can choose to go to the same building for five days a week at the same time every morning to do the same tasks with the same people. Or I can choose to awaken whenever my mind is rested, go wherever my will takes me, meet whomever is there, and do whatever we feel like doing. It might be risky, but it sure isn't boring.

## Zen and the Art of Ownership Exorcism

Once I had wiggled free of work, the next tautest tethers tied me to possessions. I rid myself of stuff, which proved a bit complicated because I didn't want to give it all away. I rather preferred to liquidate it and take its value on the road with me. So I sold much of my furniture, repaid a debt and paid it forward with my kitchen equipment, donated the stuff I didn't want and couldn't sell, and stored the rest in a neighborhood storage unit. My rent is now $200 a month. All of my possessions fit in three bags that ride behind me on the motorcycle seat.

### What do I really need to carry?

In the weeks prior to my departure, I spent a lot of time paring down my packing list to the bare essentials. First I brainstormed a list of all the things I could imagine wanting with me. It added up to about five times more than I thought would be plausible to carry with me. Then I systematically peeled away non-necessities ("What will a sportcoat do for me that a smile and a nice scarf couldn't?"), found redundancies ("Tights and underwear do virtually the same thing, but I can't wear underwear as pants, so…"), and aimed for multi-functional items like my Patagonia coat that is waterproof, windproof, lightweight, super-packable, and comfortable from -20ºC to 20ºC.

Eventually I pared it down to under 100 liters of gear. In the summer I bet I could optimize my cargo down to 60L, which would place me soundly within the year-round backpacker range. But with my trusty steed by my side, I don't have a strong reason to leave anything else behind. With my bags securely tied onto the seat behind me, I've got a nice backrest and the bike feels stable and balanced.

After a month on the road, I've regularly used all of the things I packed, save for three: a yoga towel, a climbing harness, and a hanky. I had forgotten I had the hanky until just now, so that'll join the regular rotation. Riding one's motorcycle around in December yields a runny nose or two, and kleenex don't grow on trees you know. The climbing harness is ultralight to begin with, so I don't mind lugging that around in case opportunity to get vertical with some new friends presents itself. And the towel? Isn't there some popular aphorism about towels and traveling? I forget how it goes…

### Balance fuels the journey

I maintain momentary, infinitesimal balance as I rocket down the highway. As David the Vegan Rider, a lifelong Joshua Tree native I met at [Pappy & Harriet's](http://www.pappyandharriets.com), would chortle, "Rubber side down, paint side up, at any cost." He once laid his bike down to avoid smearing a herd of children that had migrated onto the road ahead. As he tells it, he ended up sitting cross-legged atop his downed machine as it skidded to a halt—balance even in crisis. (If you ever find yourself to be an herbivore at Pappy & Harriet's, ask for the veggie burger topped with veggie chili, and a side of fries also topped with veggie chili. Tell 'em David sent you.)

![Pappy & Harriet's is the Pioneertown cornerstone]()

I strive to sustain gradual, cyclic balance as I choose my path. Where to go? Whom to meet? What to carry? What to write? These choices renew my soul; they fill my senses with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, feelings, love, and purpose. I allow these aspects of my life to fall out of balance so that I may enjoy the satisfaction of restoring them. Solitude leads me to value company all the more, and _vice versa_. Hunger improves my dinner. A thirst long held is a thirst best slaked. The same goes for a full bladder. Leaping and bounding, scrambling and climbing over the alien rock formations in Joshua Tree was even more elevating after two sedentary weeks of riding and writing. Black Betty rides like a dream once I reach my destination, remove my cargo, and tear off toward the horizon to salute the sunset. There is such joy and fulfillment in recognizing a point of balance, then dancing between its opposing extremes.

Most of all though I seek to attain wholesome, longitudinal balance within myself as I journey and progress and grow. It would be easy to view my recent behavior as 'leaving'. I left San Francisco, this is true. A more relativistic analyst might tell us that San Francisco also left me, and that I just happened to simultaneously recognize and acknowledge that development. I certainly felt that way.

But from my perspective I have not left anything. I have not fled. My eyes are not in the back of my head. Sure, I have trimmed away the customary trappings of ritual and routine. I never liked those temporal lampreys continually sucking the joy out of my life and the time out of my days. But no, I am not running away. I am running toward! Toward a world of seven-point-three billion people I have never met. Toward a world of two-hundred-million square miles I have never trod. Toward the tribe to which I belong that as yet has no name. Toward the love I bear inside and the need to share it with as many as I can.

### Time to **_pretire_**

Tell me how I can do any of this working a desk job to raise profits to pay the rent to make it to next month to go on some dates to find love to get married to have kids to raise a family to build a home to grow old in only to retire, grow iller, and die.

I'll take the other way. I'll take on illness now while I'm strong, not all at the end of life when it may consume me. I'll burn my desk and profit on the road. I'll build a home for any family that needs one. I'll raise my friends and colleagues and I rise up against what keeps them down. I'll give love so that it may find me. I'll never retire. I've been tired of our uninspired routines since I became aware of them. I've been pretired for a long time, and I've only recently come to admit it.

## Where do you call home? When can you go home?

Giving up my apartment was the easiest tether to sever. I gave my subletting roommate a month's notice, he said okay, and after a month I left. It took a bit of effort to clear my accumulated stuff out of the place, but even that took me less than a week. And then I finally got to go home.

One night at the kitchen table at that apartment, a dear friend asked me a question that struck me a bit more poignantly than she might have meant it to. "When can you go home?" It was somewhat _non sequitur_, somewhat on topic. We often gracefully dance between the depths and shallows in our conversations. This time I missed a step, lost my balance. I had no answer for her: no true answer, no sarcastic deflection, and no precalculated retort. I reeled. I teared up. I fled to the back patio to gather myself.

At the moment, the nearest answer I could muster was "never". I did not know where home was. I did not know how to get there. And consequently I didn't know when I could go there. But these unanswerables have a way of sticking in my subconscious, so it wasn't long before I had a more complete answer.

### "Never. I can never go home. Because I am always home."

Since then I've had oodles of novel encounters and new experiences. But there is one point that remains contentious with the bright and brave souls I come across on my journey, one conversation that has been recurring. It goes a lot like the one Danell Lynn recounts in [her blog about her Guinness record-breaking motorcycle voyage](https://danelllynn.wordpress.com/2015/05/03/experience/).

Them: "So, where do you live now?"
Me: "Here. I'm traveling."

Them: "Yeah, but where do you live? Where's home?"
Me: "I am home. Home is within. I've gotten rid of all the usual trappings we call home: sold my furniture and furnishings, stored my keepsakes, and gave up my apartment."

Them: "So where will you go back to once you're done traveling?"
Me: "Go back to?"

Them: "Yeah, where will you go back to?"
Me: "I'm going forward, not backward. Along the way I do expect to find some places that I'll want to spend more time in. But I'll live in those places just as I'm living here now."

Them: "What about your friends and family?"
Me: "I'll get to see a lot more of them now that I'm traveling. And if I choose my stops well, I find myself surrounded by friends I haven't met yet. I'm discovering that I'm a member of some unnamed migratory tribe. We're all over the place, and we're some of the coolest people I've ever met." `[[humblebrag]]?`

## Are you pretired?

I was pretired in mind and spirit for a long time before I admitted it to myself and those around me. So I imagine there may be others like me. If you're one of them, let's talk. I'm so excited to know you're out there. I'd love to meet you and hear what you plan to do with your pretirement. With all these trappings shed and tethers cut, we'll have so much time to dedicate to what really matters.
