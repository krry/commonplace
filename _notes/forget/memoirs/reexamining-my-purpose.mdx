# Reexamining my purpose

## Back to first principles

This year has brought nearly everything back into question for me. Time, love, space, speed, money, morality, conservation, mortality, gender, race, sexuality, identity, society. This year I have dug into my self in search of truth more deeply than I have since I was just a boy.

I am not sure why my personal sense of ethics has been suppressed and somewhat unquestioned for this long. I'm working through that now. Hopefully it will become clear what froze my development as a judge. Hopefully it will be a logical progression from this week's intentional epiphany.

TL:DR; I heard the call this week. I now know my vocation.

Grownups love to ask kids what they want.

"What's the matter? Are you hungry? What do you want to be when you grow up?" This is subpar parenting or mentorship. It is a question posed to a mind at its peak of imagination, asking it to start classifying itself as a one-dimensional object, a dot on the map of humanity. Whose interest does this self-reduction serve? Those who seek to stack people into pyramids of predictability would appreciate it if we all wore nametags bearing our opted-into occupations. Those who value the freedom to find bliss, the joy of serendipity, or the happiness of change are less likely to appreciate becoming one-dimensional.

Perhaps we could ask some odder questions:

- _When_ do you want to be when you grow up?
- What do you want to change about the world you know of?
- Where do you want to learn about the world you are aware of?
- How old do you want to be when you become a parent?
- Would you rather support **a few people a lot** or **a lot of people a little**?
- Why do you care about anyone else?

What different worlds might spring from these questions?

When I was a little guy, I asked 'why' too much. I heard that a lot.

Why do I cry when I try to express painful truths?
Why can't Alissa express painful truths when she cries?

The French take: "To die in the exercise of your passion." - Philippe Petit from _Man on Wire_

Inspiring perhaps. Narcissistic likely. Free climbers, squirrel suiters, moto racers, jet pilots. I once dreamed of being such as these astronauts without the ethos or the science.
