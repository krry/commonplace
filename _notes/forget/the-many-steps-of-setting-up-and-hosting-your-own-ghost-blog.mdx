# The many steps of setting up and hosting your own ghost blog

Here's the goal: your new blog is sofa king cool and all your great ideas have a dais. All you have to do is breathe, and digest about 8 hours of pain into IT. You can rest easily investing 8 hours, once you see how much time others have spent assembling all of the components that comprise this wondrously automated Gutenberg of brilliance. ![Guinness' Brilliant]()

1. Get the ghost blog code, decide if you need to build it yourself or just run `npm install --production` - I built the damn thing with grunt and bower and such, though I may not have needed to

2. Run it locally and customize it until you're happy with it - I made my own theme, got a bunch of custom fonts thanks to typography.com and Google Fonts, and set the color palette and logos among a few other standard CSS reset things that were missing. I set my new theme up on SASS, made sure all elements abide the border-box-sizing, optimizeLegibility, and anti-aliased text-rendering that make-a look real niccccccce.

3. Select a host. I used [the Ghost guide](http://docs.ghost.org/installation/deploy/) to help me get going. I choose DigitalOcean after trying AWS (they remembered that I'd tried them a while back and denied me a trial first-year like most of y'all would get).

I tried Heroku first (they tend to wipe Ghost databases unless you jump through some hoops), and then tried to fit a round peg in a square hole by attempting to host a blog on Divshot. Divshot specializes in hosting static web apps. I am a little fuzzy on the 'static' part there, but I think a blog you can edit once it's on the server does not qualify as static. Perhaps a static web app may show dynamic content via services and API calls, but it's own code remains static once deployed.

4. Configure your DNS to allow your host to use your domain name. I use DNSimple for domainy shit, they stay out of my way and make shit work. DigitalOcean, my host, asked for full NS swap, which I abided because had to.

5. Then start configuring your server. `ssh` into that scraper piece and start learning linux. There are [slight differences in commands and package managers](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwitchingToUbuntu/FromLinux/RedHatEnterpriseLinuxAndFedora), but they pretty much do the same damn things. I chose Ubuntu because it's more well-used and I figured there would be more noobs already asking stupid questions on StackFlowExchange. it ought to have you set a root password on your first login
   ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` // IP address, not xxx
   cd ~

6. Get latest system software

```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get git
sudo apt-get nodejs
sudo apt-get npm
```

6.1. If you install `nodejs` on an Ubuntu box via apt-get, it might not let you use `node` as the run command (instead it lets ax25-node have the namespace and `node` is relegated to `nodejs`). this jacked up a lot of out-of-the-box scripts for me until I symlinked `nodejs` to `node` like so:

```bash
ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

7. Deploy your local ghost to a remote repo, I used github, made it private becuz security. **first, make and name your <ghost_repo> on [github](http://github.com)**

```bash
cd ~/path/to/<ghost_repo>
git init
git add .
git commit -am "it's alive!"
git remote add git@github.com:<your_github_username>/<ghost_repo>.git
```

8. Set up your server to be able to git that repo
   Off to <b><i>key</i></b>ndyland:
   `cd ~/.ssh`
   Grind it out:
   `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "krry@me.com"`
   Run dat agent:
   `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
   Add it to das keychain:
   `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
   Testit:
   `ssh -T git@github.com`
   `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   copy your RSA key to your local system clipboard, then paste it into [Github's list of RSA keys on your account](https://github.com/settings/ssh)
9. Clone dat repo into a nice spot

```bash
mkdir /var/www/ghost
cd /var/www/ghost
git clone git@github.com:<github_username>/<github_repo_name>.git
```

10. Set up the server to auto-run your ghost app. Find `YOUR_NODE_PATH` with this:
    `which node`
    then dive into the curls:
    `sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Config/master/init.d/ghost -o /etc/init.d/ghost`
    just a trim here, and a trim there:

```bash
	vi /etc/init.d/ghost
GHOST_ROOT=/path/to/ghost
DAEMON=<NODE_PATH>
```

11. Set up a _ghost_ user group, make your _root_ a part of the group
    `sudo useradd -r ghost -U`
    to check what users are laying in the cut (like neosporin):
    `cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd`
12. Set the permissions so that the 'ghost' has partial `chownership` and can `chmodify` important files like `config.js` once deployed

```bash
	sudo chown -R ghost:ghost /var/www/ghost
sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/ghost
```

13. Time for everyone's favorite reaming: web server config
    `which nginx`
    if null results:
    `sudo apt-get install nginx`
    in Soviet Russia, nginx configures you
    `vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost.conf`
    in there make the configs say right things

```javascript
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <your_host_url.tld>;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   Host      $http_host;
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:2368;
    }
}
```

```javascript
server {
    listen 0.0.0.0:80;
    server_name <your.domain.name>;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/<your-domain-name>.log;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2368;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```

then when you're done, link it up and RAWRstart your web server:
`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ghost.conf`
`sudo service nginx restart`

14. Then set up the server to forever run your app even after deploys and power cycles. you can `apt-get pm2` or `apt-get supervisor` or `apt-get forever`. I choose `supervisor` which took some doing as the Ghost docs weren't spot on, but after not doing this, I did this, which worked:

It's apt to get it installed, supervisor.
`sudo apt-get install supervisor`
"Configure it out yourself, I'm tired and drunk", said your dad.
`vi /etc/supervisor/conf.d/ghost.conf`
Start it up:
`supervisorctl start ghost`
or you might need to specify the `.conf` file, I'm not sure:
`supervisorctl -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf start ghost`

15. Pull the ripcord. these make sure the ghost floats on its own:

```bash
sudo update-rc.d ghost defaults
sudo update-rc.d ghost enable
sudo adduser <your_admin_server_username> ghost
```

16. Safen your haven. Get an SSL certificate from some sleazy cryptographer on the virtual street corner. Copy that greasy little cert to the system clipboard from a super secure plaintext email and paste into a hidden spot on your server:
    `vi /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt`
    then put that stankin' cert in its place:
    `mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl`
    `cp /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt`
17. Build the ghost app on the server
    Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm install --production
```

Gather the front-end packages
`bower install --allow-root`
Run with the boars
`grunt init --verbose`
