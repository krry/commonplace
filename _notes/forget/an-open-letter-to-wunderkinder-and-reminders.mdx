# An Open Letter To Wunderkinder And Reminders

An Open Letter to Wunderkinder and Reminders

I've used Wunderlist since the beginning of Wundertime. In the past couple years, many things have gotten to-do, then gotten done thanks to Wunderlist's game-changing, cross-platform ease of use and graceful reminder entry.

Then iOS5/iCloud/Reminders happened. I started using Reminders at its launch, just for shiggles. I played with importing Tasks from my Google Apps into Reminders—nonplussed. I gave Siri a few hundred chances to figure out what I want to be reminded to do—nonplussed. I dug until my touchscreen bled trying to figure out why Apple didn't flat-out, cash-money buy Wunderlist and drop it wholly into iOS 5. Science knows I didn't have anything else to-do.

They seem to have thought they grow a better to-do app on an Apple tree.

It wasn't until the iOS 6 release (closely following Wunderkinder's decision to jettison Wunderkit, I believe) that I migrated my dozens of to-do lists from Wunderlist into Reminders. Reminders had gotten a smidge better, and the 6 had shaken my trust in their sticktoitiveness. A time-consuming copy-paste job perhaps; one I was hoping not to repeat.

In Reminders, my lists of to-dos remain relegated—thanks to the overly skeuomorphic interface—to a shadowy sidebar bucket in Nevergettingdoneland. Lost in the shadows, big ideas lurk undone. Instead they float in the dark, airless abyss of Reminders, untied to time or space due to Reminders' tiny controls and mouse-heavy interface

At this point, unfortunately, the answer to your question is neither. Apple has imposed a bit of a stalemate. Take Isaac's word for it: Siri can be very helpful when it comes to adding tasks. But in my experience Siri takes reminders like I bowl: inaccurately.
