## Journal of Kerrbear

The random rediscovered writing of the day is [[convergence-of-study---modern-replacements]].

Here I attempted by a string of analogies to illustrate the broken methodology at the core of civilization. This was long before I had encountered the clarity of Charles Eisenstein. But around this time I had become aware of the toxicity of our material scientism and the military-industrial complex of technocapitalism that rains fear and illusion upon us, goads us to replace our selves with silicon and petroleum-based facsimiles.

Perhaps I can tease a cohesive thought out of all this spaghetti.
