# 2020-01-01

- A new year begins. How momentous.
  - 2020 could have been better, clearer, easier, more active.
  - Fear was the operative game.
  - I can't say I felt more fearful last year than others, but I witnessed the effects of widespread fear all around me, and I certainly felt the secondhand fear.
- [[resolutions]] #Resolutions #SquadGoals
  - Focus on fatherhood
    - on giving without looking for exchange
    - on giving without asking for anything
    - on self-care and self-soothing so I can be strong and helpful
    - on providing money, food, shelter
  - Get organized
    - A [[commonplace-book]] in Plain Sight for All to Read comprising:
      - This [[roam]]
      - [[sanity]]
      - [[easeness]] for business stuff
      - [Atmanaut.me](https://Atmanaut.me) for woowoo
      - [Atmanautica.com](https://Atmanautica.com) for contracting
    - Notebooks for poems but catalog poems here
  - Keep a calendar
    - Why not? If only I had a good app for that. Oh wait....[[roam]]!
    - Elysa is good at it. Try collaborating.
