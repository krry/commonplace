# Thursday, March 4, 2021

Amazing! This will work very well.

## Checking in

Tonight in these wee hours when the babby somewhat slumbers at my elbow I am:

- [x] reconsidering where to rehost my Roam graph and how to use it
- [x] learning about Zettelkasten and how to read and write more effectively
- [x] looking at [digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), wherein we can share our incomplete and freeform ideas in order to see what grows
  - is [Atmanaut.me](https://Atmanaut.me) a garden? kind of. a metaphysical gardeno
  - is [Easeness.business](https://Easeness.business)? perchance. kinda focused on an ethos
- [x] Next to integrate the Obsidian vault with this repo.
- [ ] start hoeing up the turf to plant my [[digital garden]]

## [[Commonplace Book]]

- surveying Zettelkasten (card index) tools

  - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
    - Mac app that uses md, so closed source
    - similar to Roam, but uses md and not everything is a bullet
    - autoconverts Roam and Bear syntax to `md`-friendly format
  - [Athens](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens)
    - Mac app that simulates Roam
    - an open source Roam clone
    - doesn't seem to offer advantages beyond Roam and lags behind the features of Roam
  - [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/)
    - MDX in VS Code + Git
    - open source, Roamy, and also quirky and garnering its own community
    - plays well with Obsidian since they both use `md` and can be versioned with Git
  - there are many more that I've weeded out and will not detail here

- I'm going to start out with a combo of:

  - [x] Obsidian for local editing and the main event
  - [x] Foam for publishing to a web-friendly digital garden and syncing with Github
  - [ ] [Foamy NextJS](https://github.com/yenly/foamy-nextjs) for providing the graph in a readable format
    - [ ] and Netlify for publishing the NextJS app
    - [ ] or maybe I'll use adapt this graph-friendly Jekyll theme for Github Pages and call it **Jekyllkasten** which is hard to deny

- [[Reading]] better

  - tear-out notes instead of margin notes
  - color-coded highlighting
  - after reading do a processing phase
    - follow/develop a process
    - collect notes
    - write a summary
  - [Barbell Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/barbell-method-reading/)
    - read swiftly once, marking notable passages
    - read the marked passages again, processing and expanding your insights

- [[Writing]] notes
  - A Zettel has:
    - metadata
      - title
      - date
      - tags
    - content
    - source
      - citation in MultiMarkdown? - [more on citations](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/bibliography-zettelkasten/)

## Gratitude

Today I feel grateful for Zephyr Bear's tiny steady nose breaths while he sleeps peacefully in his Dock-a-tot on the table next to my elbow. That at barely three weeks old he is sleeping at night and breathing through his nose, I am beyond amazed. And he can nearly hold his head up. What a wonder this kid is and will be.

And I feel grateful for diligent folks sharing their adventures. Folks like [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) and [Yenly](https://yenly.wtf) who have graciously led me toward the [[digital-garden]] that will be home for so many scattered noodlings and loose leaves.
