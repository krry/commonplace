## Journal of Kerrbear

A lovely Sunday!

Plenty of quality time with Baby Bear and Momma Bear

Had a great planning meeting with @ibash.
Off to a great start with Summon.

Tuned up [[commonplace]] to display metadata next to the notes. And restored the nav to the sidebar.

Decided to use Teuxdeux as my task manager again. Paid them for a year. I mean it this time.

On another happy note, I've just rediscovered my [[2021-resolutions]] and I'm making great progress this year.

[commonplace]: ../../intend/commonplace "Commonplace"
[2021-resolutions]: 2021-resolutions "2021 Resolutions"
