- Ack, what a day of codez..
- I moved all my deploy apps from the hobby account with Vercel to my Atma team account.
- This went smoothly and was a lot.
- Now I have a lot of web apps deployed, which is a lot to maintain:
  - [Nameless](https://nameless.atmanaut.us) - divination
  - [Easeness](https://easeness.biz) - business commentary
  - [Atmanaut.me](https://atmanaut.me) - musings and such
  - [Atmanautica.com](https://atmanautica.com) - folio and playground
  - [Atmanaut.us](https://atmanaut.us) - the hub for hobbies
  - [og.easeness.biz](https://og.easeness.biz) - social image generator
  - [Sanity Studio](https://atmanautica.sanity.studio) - CMS for some of the above
  - [Passage](https://passage.atmanaut.us) - the relativity clock
- Pending new projects:
