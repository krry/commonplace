- Conceiving of [[Consciousness vs. Self-Consciousness]]
  - Read [this great article by Ibram X Kendi](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/denial-heartbeat-america/617631/)
    - He would have us believe that denial is the heart beat of [[America]]
    - This is true
    - And also indicates that the heart of America is rotten and corrupt and not long for this world
    - An organism or organization that holds its own negation at its core soon implodes or metastasizes into a tumorous golemic effigy of its former supposed self
    - The bigger picture shows us that as the internet ties us together, our need for the nation as a unit of organization is dwindling to nil. Our minds, as the factories of fear that they are, are conspiring to explain, to justify, to give reasons for the loss of identity that result from the death and decay of the nation state. Our minds, and the egos they ossify and protect as they weave a net of fears, often place [[nationalism]] centrally in our metaphorical coats of arms.
      - If we were to draw up the shield that portrays our identity, what would be at the center? What ties the other pieces together?
      - Many of us have been conditioned to believe that our national belonging is core to our being, when really it is only a thin coating personality on the fragile, crusty balloon that is the ego.
