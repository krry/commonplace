# Kerrbear's Journal 2020 Dec 27

- After Midnight, we gonna let it all hang out, right Eric?
- Second day, cruising along. And only 5 pages into Get Real, but already I can see how this will fill out.
- I'll need a better global structure to keep things organized.
  - So I'm evaluating [[PARA]] from Tiago Fortelabs.co
- Tried to style the Roam with custom CSS as mentioned in [this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY-sAC2eGyI) from #Conor

  - but the code blocks aren't editable

  ```markup
  <p>oh, they are now! had to close and reload the roam</p>
  ```

  - [x] off to [[roam/css]] to make a dark mode!

- winding down, I didn't make as much progress as I would've liked.
  - got caught up making it pretty as I often do
  - but I also worked out the bones so further entry will be smooth
