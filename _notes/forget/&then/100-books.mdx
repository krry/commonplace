# 100 Books I Love

[Following Darius Foroux's lead](https://medium.com/life-learning/100-great-books-to-read-in-a-lifetime-f3b7069ce8b3), I'm now inspired to share some of the books that have formed my mind over the years. My list may weigh more towards fiction, and it may weigh in at less than 100 tomes.

Rather than attempt to alphabetize them from my phone, or rank them—a feat I'll shy from just as Darius did—I'll lay them down stream of consciousness.

### on the mind

- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig
- Lila also by Robert Pirsig
  - notably the author describes the Zettelkasten system on his houseboat that he used to write the book

### on civilization

- Catch-22 by Joseph Heller
- 1984
- A Handmaid's Tale by Octavia Butler
  - surely Octavia has more books I would relish

### on technology

- I, Robot by Isaac Asimov

### on being

- A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin
  - I hear she has another that is an account of utopia
- Tao Te Ching, especially UKLG's interpretation
- Be As You Are, which presents the teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi
- Be Here Now, by Richard Alpert and the friends of Baba [[Ram Dass]]
