# Detachment

You are aware. You have a body. You are not this body. You are awareness embodied.

As we forget who we are, we become attached to what we are not: being human. Adrift in our profound innate ignorance, we grope for whatever flotsam bobs by. Often the hand that catches ours in the waves is our own. We attach to the idea that we are humans being, human-beings, an attachment that quickly ossifies. And as we exist as a human, it becomes petrifying to believe that this short time as such a vulnerable, minuscule meatbag is all we get when the universe we can observe in the stars above is so vast. How can this be it!?

Our prime directive is to climb out of the pit of delusion that we slip into, that our elders and peers push us into. The first and only step to reach bliss is detachment. The Truth is inside you, waiting for you to admit it. You are here. You just are. You're not going anywhere, but you can for now direct your attention and set your intentions and with your body sense how your experience changes, and with your mind model those experiences and those changes, and you can feel good when you move toward the Truth, and you will feel bad when you lose sight of it.
