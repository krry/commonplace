# Thoughts On Tville

## Principles of TVille content

1. parental approval - safe environment in which kids can play and learn according to parents
2. fun - above all, keep kids coming back with fun activities and engaging social platform that their parents encourage
   - keep it fun for parents too; incentivize parents to give feedback
3. education - impart socialization, mathematics, language, even morals
4. futurism - preparing children for the socio-technological issues they will confront by helping them grow accustomed to algorithms, interacting with networks of computers and people, and achieving economies of scale - forward-looking
5. real world metaphor/simile - connect online experience with real life consistently in positive ways
6. automated content filters - hall monitors and crossing guards as algorithms that approve quips based on parental feedback - can even have parents spend more money on better algorithms to allow their children more freedom to play since the cost of filtering will go up, but make it fun as characters, funny janitors, busdrivers, etc.

## How am I results-oriented?

I can't quit things. Once I decide they are worthwhile, I see them through.
I finish every book I start, except 20,000 Leagues under the sea, and beat every game I play.
However this perseverance does not translate into cutthroat competition since I would rather everyone do their best and better themselves along with me. Instead I try to form teams. Hence Third Prime, hence the Scorpions, hence my squad of barbacks. I needn't lead these teams, the most suited should lead and there can be many forms of leadership.

## What are your weaknesses?

I come off as confrontational and argumentative because I challenge people's assumptions. I need to find less aggravating ways of achieving the same result.
I have trouble with repetition. I don't like repeating myself when I speak. I don't like reiteration, doing the same task over and over without variation or improvement. This also drives me to seek results, wishing to finish and move on to something more interesting.
