# Betty Bye

As the day ends
softly close your eyes.
Thanks for playing
see you when we rise.

Come with me and
gently close your eyes
Thanks for saying
What we need tonight.

As our day ends
we softly close our eyes.
Thanks for making us
Lala lam la la
Lam lala lambrusco

As your stay ends
breathe a sweet goodbye

I'm glad to say you
sparkled all our eyes.
Thanks for pausin
Left us here to smile.

Come with me and
gently close your eyes
Thanks for saying
What we mean to sigh.

As our day ends
we softly close our eyes.
Thanks for making us
Lala lam la la
