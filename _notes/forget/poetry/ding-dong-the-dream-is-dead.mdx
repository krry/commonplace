# Ding Dong the Dream is Dead

You're probly wondering what that smell is, /
that infected stench of puss and rot. /
It's time we laid our dreams to rest, /
released the clench and nodded off. /
They've been deader than a doornail /
since a pangolin had known a bat, or vice versa. /
Out of the frying pandemic and into the forest fire, amirite?

Carrying them around won't bring them back. \
Dragging—dropping dead—entrails along the trail \
may get you followers (if hand-holding zombies count), \
and it may get you rich (what's the fly-to-dollar exchange rate?) \
but it won't turn back time, \
and it won't bring your dead dreams back.

We're sorry for your loss. \
Please accept our deepest condolences. \
We know you had it all planned out. \
You were doing your best \
(based on that now-obsolete conception of the world) \
and **_now what?_**

> When will we get THAT FUCKING VACCINE \
> so things can go back to how it used to be!?

The answer I have is the one no one wants. \
We are never going back. \
Time moves forward. \
The story goes on. \
This too shall pass. \
Life evolves, we move, through struggles to grow love.

Did Rosie the Riveter expect things to go back to normal? \
Did she long for her apron and curlers?
Maybe baseball _needs more crying_. \
The Rockford Peaches would have kept playing \
if only their husbands and sons had remained in the trenches.

Before we move on, before we can fly, we need to let go.

William Cliff the Guillemot stands on a cliff in the wind on an island. \
See Cliff teeter. \
Cliff is young, only a chick, or a gosling, an auklet, if you will. \
See Cliff awkwardly teeter on a seacliff. \
Cliff's mother Murriel skims the cliff. \
Mother Murre sings to Cliff, "Be free, Willy! Fly!" \
See Cliff teeter and topple and tumble \
and plummet \
ponderous and pillowy \
into the seaspray, into the breach.

If we are each to wear the crown, \
if we are all to reign sovereign, \
first we must surrender.

When we accept responsibility for being, \
we achieve liberation by abandoning freedom.

"What _about_ free will? \
If we choose love, \
there are no more choices to make," \
said the bat to the pangolin.
