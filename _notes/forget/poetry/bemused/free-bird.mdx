# Free Bird

A free bird ponders another breeze  
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees  
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawn  
and she names the sky her own

A free bird names the world in trills  
and the skies dance in swirls and rolls
and the earth, its fertile Goddess  
and they both carry a bird's solace.

A free bird sows seeds to one day embrace  
with wind-strong wings foreign breezes seasoned
with older names for earth and sky  
and he warms them with cultured breaths.

A bird can sing of freedom or have it  
and it roosts where the breeze may please  
and it strikes a caged bird's heart  
to leave alee for asea.

Two birds freed see distant shores  
and they hurt no one at peace  
and they further their worth and causes   
and they sow seeds to later embrace
with their wind-strong wings.
