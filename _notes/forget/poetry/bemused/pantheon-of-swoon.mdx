# Pantheon of Swoon

We storm the Swoon Mountain,
set camp at the peak
overlooking House Eden
with thorns at our feet.

A particular persimmon–
found and lost, lost and found–
drinks up our bathwater
and shows me around.

The camp fire is lit
and swarmed by kazoosts
in search of their leader
as the cockawoop boosts.

Feelings parade on the march
and I've lost self and mind.
The gods in us are out now.
Unveil the divine.

These children on the mountain,
some pantsed and some sans,
nestle into the squishions,
tug heartstrings, hold hands.

Marty thunders the Cathedral
with his fallen angel band.
We drive away the demons
as we stomp into a trance.

I swoop up the squad
who've sung up the moon.
Stars out and hearts open
we brace for full swoon.

Elven and shadowed,
a wizard called SØRNE,
a symphonic cacophony,
blasts chakras, casts storm.

I wash up on the balcony
carried away by the waves.
Then return to my body
to realize I'm on stage.

We're puddles already when
Grammy Cass takes her throne.
She's a host for the angels,
heals heartbreak, intones,

"I only have one happy song,
and I already played it."
She unleashes a tempest,
leaves Agapolis a-gaping.

As Aurora ushers in a new era
Some puddle where pews might be
Some hike up to sleep in the trees
Some reintegrate over tea.

Pillows in the valley
accumulate to the brim:
pasteled watervapors,
vespers' embers within.

Midas strums out a prophecy
Here Comes the Sun
Dawn resonates with Chelsea
we feed apples to bees.

Dawn breaks on Olympus.
The usual gods shuffle in.
Pam aligns our five triangles
as the sun bathes our skin.

Is the world still out there?
Can we ever go back?
Creativity unlocked,
we soak, then get packed.

The gate halts our egress.
Could this be our fate?
Boundless love and abundance?
We make our escape.
