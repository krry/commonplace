# Dreamliner

Welcome aboard Air Iguana.
We know you have many ways to fly, so we thank you for joining us.
Please find your seat steadfastly.
Each one is A-1-Alpha.
We are sure you will get on as we blast off.

Please avail yourself of any passing amenities or petting manatees, and before takeoff, ensure your carcass is in a back down and feet up, position. (Who's the happy baby?)
We expect to encounter minimal turbulence as we ascend through increasingly pillowy layers of the cloud atlas to reach our cruising altitude of two million miles.

Should a breathing apparatus appear before you during our journey, exhale fully, choose a side, and draw in sharply until you, the apparatus, your fellow passengers, and our illustrious 787 Dreamliner dissolve into the blissful void of infinity. Oh and be a rose and tell the seatbelt sign to fuck right off. 

First Consent.  
Then Bliss.  
Safety third.  
Trust is paramount.

As our attendants pass through the cabin, please have your cardio tables folded up, chakras wide open, and knees tucked neatly into your armpits. Our destination lies deep within you with an estimated time of arrival of half past whenever you collapse back into your simulacrum.

Once again we thank you for billowing with us on this inaugural voyage of the Air Iguana 787 Dreamliner. Upon landing please untuck your knees, leave your chakras open, carefully rummage through the overhead bins for any belongings that may have shifted during our journey, and proceed to baggage carousel Zed Nil Omega. A shuttle awaits to usher you into the lap of absurdist luxury in the heartmouth of the Rose.

Here at Air Iguana we pride ourselves on our willful hospitality and ad hoc serendipity. Should you require assistance at any point in our journey, please peer deeper into the karuna residing at the base of your existence. Here you will find a winsome catalog of all the posh comforts of home ready in a shake.

Tootles!
