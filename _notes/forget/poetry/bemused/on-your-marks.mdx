# On your marks

stop catching yourself and fall
stop self-searching and feel
stop seeking, striving, grasping, dying
stop to question what you believe and why
stop reading and write your truth

ready?

give a care, shit, give a damn
give the last bite to your fam
give the first kiss once you've asked with your heart in your gaze
give yourself a break and go play
give me a nibble on your third ear lobe

set?

go make friends with your bright future
go make love to your flaky scalp and your back cricks
go back to where you came from and spin a cocoon of dread
go sing it at the fountain, what you wish and dream to be
go headlong off the cliff at breakneck speed and learn to fly

â€” on your marks
