# One Last KissSo I was sitting in the garden of good
And evil reigns supreme
But I got my hoe in my hand
And my feet in the dirt that feeds
The weeds of my soul
I got nothin' to say
What do you know
You seem pretty normal to me
Would you like to be with me
When the doves fly free
Just you & me and the birds & the bees
We'll just buzz baby baby . . .

Shake your tailfeathers like you got a pair
But I prefer apples and oranges
Sour grapes make me pucker up
So don't be afraid
Lay down a fat one, it's heavy anyways
And if you weren't so frail I wouldn't like you anyways
