# Black MagicAlready I get down when I see her get up
Now I can see down where she keeps her C-cups
And I'm so down with Vickie's Secret pushups
I frown now, out loud now, how down now, get up

Stop that cryin' boy, I didn't raise me no little bitch
Ya own dick is a fine toy, I ain't afraid to scratch my own itch
Don't wanna hear you whine coy-ly 'bout tryin' to park it in her ditch
'Cuz where you find joy won't be under the spell of a mad witch

So settle simmer down no need to get up
Baby now you down-town time to hit up
Grab ya fellas who are down now it's time to split up
The magnetic forces between athletic whores's ankles
Keeping their pink pink and not white
Cuz black magic courses through my veins not yourses
Keeping your dick limp and lips not quite as tight
