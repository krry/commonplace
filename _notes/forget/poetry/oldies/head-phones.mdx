# Head PhonesSo I wake up this morning
Break up a dream about scoring
When I notice what I'm ignoring
My own erection's imploring
"Please Head the Smarter go back to sleep,
Let me head a little farther into the deep
chasm where I can spasm
squirt in the dirt 
and the mud, you know you should."
He ain't as dumb as he looks
He's only worth what he fucks
But I'm nothin' without fuckin'
Bookin' nookie in a pickup truck bed
