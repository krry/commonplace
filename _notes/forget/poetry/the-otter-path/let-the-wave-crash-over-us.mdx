# Let the wave crash over us 🌊

we can breathe deep enough 🧘
we can hold on tight 🤝
we can tumble in the undertow 🌀
and forget which way is up 💠
again and know that we will rise together 🪁
as the salty tide subsides

I'd love a steamy cleanse
we can soak and sweat
and sob and swear
and find the strength we need
to unravel our knots
and knit ourselves together
