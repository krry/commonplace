# F it

Whenever I pull this out
stuff gets screwy
best writer I know
fucking galaxies
still we keep editing
non-violet indigo
blue pencil

when you look at we with those everything eyes

walkin on fumes
runnin been done
coast in to cali/cankles
the given is up

soles to the ceiling
heaven's back in
the cell where we left it

knock knock
who's there
please knock hard
please knock hard who?
please knock hard who loves ya.

I'm your furnace
you're my heat sink
drop the stopper
let the meat think

Somewonderful
gave me
the pass code
to
the
lucy
lockup
and I've been
wayfaring
loving every
(one/thing)
till now
when I stopped
to lance this blis....

And we're back.
That was a pussy mess.
Life lesson #732
Affix kisser to blossom.
Bring wipes.
Forgot who
I was talking too
much?

Left right left
nothing to be here.
Just your typical
run-of-the-mill bass, t-
this far from the tree-unk
it's tough to find shade
but I'm sure it's there.

We found seven halves
of chain links.
Found that jail's made for escape.
A lion has pride.
Trash tag! Dub le pause.
Steel finds ground.
Wind tumbles down.
Carne asana ariana.
Maxin we beyonsonna.

Which might take some unpacking;
I can allow this to happen.
See, the be is we,
and the yon is nearer
than it ever deemed to be
come son,
beyond the sun lies
the wonders one day
beams onto/into
the grande meatspace
we
unwittingly
unwaveringly
unabashedly
blasterriftastically
invade
as we wake into yet another day
we cheer up.
