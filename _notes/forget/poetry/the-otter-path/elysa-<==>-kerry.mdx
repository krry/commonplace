# Blip Blop

I am you are being who

My love. I‚Äôm not long
for this world... meaning
i will soon fast asleep. 
But my mind will find
yours soon. We‚Äôll 
dream waltz in a
galaxy-scape,
to cellos and humstrums
;)

You're writing me words
that transport me and
make me think of
other worlds
and
meanwhile I'm
here in my
normal bed
on a normal
monday night
I can smell you
on my pillow
I'm in both places.

How did we end up
on the planet
in the same place
at the same time
and found each other?

::affinity::

You are most definitely
a creature from another galaxy
and I'm glad that you came
all the way here.

::same self sees us::

As the planet abides
us to float with the stars
we'll toe tap out sighs
and slow smiles we have caged
then the walls will be heavens
and the skies will be dreams
what always will have been
so we sing, so we sing.

Feeling the last of
the sun‚Äôs rays on my face
I know I'd be warmer
with your heat around me
But it‚Äôs still
nice in
this serene place.
Wishing pelicans
adieu to
wherever they‚Äôre going.

many songs have been sung
about the ways we will go
and many more ring out
to color the distant skies
we'll notice and graffiti

your songs are my heartbeats
your feet and my hands meet
on even plains
seldom exchanges
sweet as these

monkey bars and frisbee
and cartwheels
and tennis balls
in the basketball hoops

# Somewonderful
gave me
the pass code
to
the
lucy
lockup
and I've been
wayfaring
loving
every
(one/thing)
till now
when I stopped
to lance this blis....

And we're back.
What a pussy mess.

Life lesson [[432/3]]
Affix kisser to blossom.
Bring tube wipes.

Forgot who
I was talking too
much?

Left right left
nothing to be here.
Just your typical
run-of-the-mill bass, t-
this far from the tree-unk
it's tough to find shade
but I'm sure it's there.

We found seven halves
of chain links.
Found that jail
's made for escape.

A lion has pride
until days end.
Trash tag! Dub le pause.
Steel finds ground.
Wind tumbles down.
Carne asana Ariana?
Maxin. We Bey≈ç√±s≈çna.

Which might take some unpacking;
I can allow this to happen.
See, the Be is we,
and the Bey is way true
and the yo√± is √±earer
than it ever deemed to be
c≈çme s≈çn,
bey≈çnd the s√ºn lies
the w≈çnders
≈çne day beams
onto/into
the grande
meatspace we
unwitting
ly
unwavering
ly
unabashed
ly
blasterriftastically
invade as we 
wake into yet
another day.
We cheer up.

Soon I won‚Äôt be far
From you at the writing bar
My hugs can help cure 
the blues, I‚Äôve heard...
but don‚Äôt want to intrude 
If you need a solo brood
Let me know, amor of mine,
If i can bring you some sunshine.
‚ù§‚òÄüíã

This morning woke
with a fantasy-like dream
of a masquerade ball. I
knew i was searching
the room for you while
dancing slowly in the sea
of hoods and cloaks,
but only eyes
were visible (could be seen)
under the masks...
the music kept speeding
up until i was dashing
between the bodies and everything
blurred.

Every pair of eyes
i caught weren‚Äôt yours,
though i knew exactly
what to look for,
I couldn‚Äôt find them.
I woke up out of breath.

But transparently,
thank you for caring
about my needs and stating
your own.
You can always
ask as well, I‚Äôm
practicing voicing
better (something
i found harder
to do
after specific relationships).
üíï

you flash float to mind
butterfly heart dance
suddenly tighter pants
purse kisser
catch my breath

So you know...
You‚Äôre making my heart grow. And I am taking in more 
than i ever hoped for
With more capacity and attention
I‚Äôm filling up my love cup
And it‚Äôs changing everything, everything, everything.
‚ù§‚ù§

And so we're clear...
it's been everywhere from here.
Sails full and beats thumping.
Lions need pride in some one.
We can barely heed
the peep of the people
we can be.
