# Wolftree Wagon

I don't feel seen
and neither do yall

No one _feels_ **seen**.

We think up a lack
and then we miss that.

"I wish I felt seen."

But seen ain't a feeling.

> Whose tears am I crying?
> I don't feel heard,
> and you _do_?

No body feels heard.
We think that it's true
and that makes it real.

"But I still want to feel
**heard** just like you are."
You can want all you want,
But it's still not a feel.

> Whose pulse am I raising?
> Whose paws am I pacing?
> Who caused this?

Who wends within a moonbathed wolf
silver shimmer
seated soothseer
sonorant shiver
silk strung in sinew
resonant still
sultry shadow
sorrowsword swallower
splayed haunches
tail coiled
embers cool
hips tender
bowl of jelly
soft belly
shoulders back
heart forward
honey tones
gentle growl
lids loose and eyes wide

head high
ears, face..
front.

> Now we feel understanding,
> don't we?

°°°

A gust from Arunachala
blows my mind clean
the void echoes triumphant
with a parade of vacants
see, only archetypes sustain
swirling in currents of chaos
ignorance waltzing oblivion
us, in essence and by nature

> Whose pause do I await?
> Whose cause do I embrace?

I tend toward a sunblissed tree
taproot in the well
loam between the toes
bark in the trunk
swing in the limbs
bend in the branch
breath in the leaves
dance in the breeze

Toes twinkle on frond frosted feet
_LAM LAM LAM_

loins elasto-ecstatic
with a bamboo back
_VAM VAM VAM_

at the core hums metta
karuna mudita
_RAM RAM RAM_

as the heart thumps
the one hug drum
_YAM YAM YAM_

and the throat spouts
a truth geyser surprise
_HAM HAM HAM_

then the high
and mighty brow unfurls
_AUM AUM AUM_

we may now
kiss the sky
or this girl

> Now I feel understood,
> and have you?

You see, on the Wolftree Wagon
arms waving, tails wagging
we don a magic mandala halo
howl at the monkey in the mirror
feel our full selves for real
and let small minds fall aside
in the forgotten forest where egos lie
unseen and unheard
waiting to rise up and strike back
at the oppressors who keep us down
