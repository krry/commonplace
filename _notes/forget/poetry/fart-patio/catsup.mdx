## Ketchup/Witchme

All that I know
is I'm breathing.

And give me back
my broken parts.

What if your eyes
close before mine?

(IMGN)
Where are we?
What the hell is going on?

(NGRD)
Just give me back
my pieces !!!!!

_sparse tight drum unroll_

Welllllllll...

I just wanna feel today.
All we can do
is keep breathing.

(A la Ingrid)
I-ah-ah-i
lo-oh-uh-ove
the way you say "Good morning"!

~~how can I catch up~~

(Imogen-ish)
Spin me round again
and rub my eyes.
This can't be happening.

~~how can I catch up~~

Just to occupy
one moment of your day
when I don't want to.

~~how can I catch up~~

All those years
they were here first.
Doin' what bunnies do
and teaching their
pitter patter
how to dance.

We are rich and
yo-oo-oo-ou
take me the way
I am-mm-mm-mm...

~~how can I catch up~~

Oily marks appear on walls.
What if we stopped having a ball.

Busy streets
amass with people
would stop to hold
their heads heavy.

My room seems wrong.

~~how can I catch up~~

Maybe it's my tongue
the proverbial bookshelf.
When I still want you,
I can unscrew the stars.

~~how can I catch up~~

Yo-oo-oo-ou
take me the way
I am-mm-mm-mm...

~~how can I catch up~~

Snow you shoved off the car
(filling my boots)
How can I catch up?
Here's where everything stops.

(timpanis fade, stage lights dim, crowd lights on blast)

Bon Fromage!
We've been the Gigwhigs!

(copious bowing for absurdly copious applause)

Oh shit, is that a wig!?

(Gigwigs stage left af and burn wigs)
