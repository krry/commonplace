# Cut Me Up (I Love Y'all the More)

You can
drill out the roots
of my wisdom teeth

You can
impact my colon
with plast-a-lick cake

You can
slice off the hood
of my family tree

You can
nuke all my flora
with antibiotics

You can
lacquer my veins
with flavor science

You can
yank out the bulbs
of my vishuddha

You can
chalk in the lid
of my inside eye

You can
steal my starry crown
with waves of 5G

But you can't
hide my light
no you can't
axe my thanks
said you can't
hush my love
