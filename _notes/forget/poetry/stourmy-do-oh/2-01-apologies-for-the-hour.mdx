# Sorry Tribe, I Care

Apologies for the hour
I'd thought I'd found my tribe
But then I remembered
you and all of them

Apologies my tribe
I've tried
But then I remembered you
and all of them.

The clouds break for a second
and then they collide
as we gaze up into the night.
The moon reflects upon us and breathes.

We have nothing to do.
We can breathe too,
with the moon, with me and you.
We can build or crumble like sandy castles in the beating sun.

Apologies to my tribe
I've traveled on
with bliss and aplomb.
With you I'll press on.
With you I'll impress those that otherwise might not be.
