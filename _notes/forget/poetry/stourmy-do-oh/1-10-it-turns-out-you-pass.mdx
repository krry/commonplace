## Track 10
# It turns out you pass

I never expected to be the last.  
No shoulds, no supposition, no past.  
We lived in the future
and we died when you passed.

My misfortune is this next breath.
Without you I crave death.
Your absence carves my void  
as rectums crave a 'roid.

It's healthy that you passed.  
I've come to terms with that.  
Your life, your choices,  
we exasperate.
  
Or please come back,
if muster you can.  
I'll wear the bridle,
I'll bear the cane.

Live long and phosphor
as Spock might grok.
But the future is nigh
and your energy is low.
