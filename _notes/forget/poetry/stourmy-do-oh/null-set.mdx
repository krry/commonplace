# NULLSET

NULLSET
NOTHING
NOT-ING
KNOTTED
UNTYING
UNTHING

It pains me deeply
to consider that no one's efforts
can lead to more bliss.
This concept steers me straight
into the grand void it describes.
I don't want to be in that void.
I don't want to lead anyone there.

A universe founded on negation
holds no appeal to me.
That universe I will leave behind.
Instead I will seek
a growing, blossoming universe
where we can elevate together,
where sadness and happiness
do not balance each other.

I wish to inhabit a universe
where the good ones can win,
where we foster a raucous imbalance
beyond contentment to bliss.

A dystopia does not require a utopia,
or *vice versa*.
We can build a better world together,
I believe.

And I fail, fail, fail, and fail again
to understand how a world
we could never even dream of improving
could be more appealing.

I fail, and I try, and I fail again.
And it won't stop me from trying.

My love believes we cannot make
anything better in the grand scheme.
Our philosophies wrestle.
Hers dictates that nothing can win,
which is a strong argument
against anyone filled with hope and guilt.
She is not wrong.
She may be dead right.
But I don't want to live in a world
where we cannot win together.
That is the least enticing
place I can imagine.
