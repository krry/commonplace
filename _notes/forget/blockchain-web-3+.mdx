# Web 3.5 - Trust has always been paramount, but absent

The tide is rising, friends. The cosmos feel very uncertain right now. A vermillion fascist runs the Oval Office. They gut-shot Net Neutrality. One Bitcoin can buy you a car. Trust in the series of tubes is at an all-time low, while usage is ever-climbing.

> Web 1.0 was the first generation of the Web. During this phase the focus was primarily on building the Web, making it accessible, and commercializing it for the first time. Key areas of interest centered on protocols such as HTTP, open standard markup languages such as HTML and XML, Internet access through ISPs, the first Web browsers, Web development platforms and tools, Web-centric software languages such as Java and Javascript, the creation of Web sites, the commercialization of the Web and Web business models, and the growth of key portals on the Web.

### Internet 1.0 was built for Cold War defense

- Pre-web
- DARPAnet: stability, redundancy, resiliency
- Usenet: text and newsgroups

## Web 2.0: +Write

- Post - blogs, social networks
- Shop - Amazon, Ebay, Etsy
- Stream - YouTube, Spotify
- Collaborate - Wikipedia
- Capture - Flickr, Instagram

### Internet 2.0 ushered in net neutrality

- Web apps
- Social networks
- E-commerce
- Ad-supported search

## Web 3.0: +Execute

> Web 3.0 will be more connected, open, and intelligent, with semantic Web technologies, distributed databases, natural language processing, machine learning, machine reasoning, and autonomous agents.
> — Nova Spivack, ["Web 3.0: The Third Generation Web is Coming"][1]

- Semantic data + APIs
- Ubiquitous terminals
- Cloud services

### Internet 3.0 is mobile and ubiquitous

## Web 3.5: +Trust

- Open - source code, contracts, rules of operation are discrete and published
- Distributed - any actor in an economy powers and records its progress
- Secure - identities, resources, and transactions are verified and records are encrypted, timestamped, and redundant.
- Democratic - voting power, the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)
- Tokens - realm-specific currency

### Internet 4.0 is ambient and artificial

- Things - APIs, smart objects, smart devices
- AIs - Alexa/Siri/Google Assistant
- Touchpoints - Dot/Homepod/Google Home
- VR/AR - Hololens/Oculus Rift/Google Daydream

## Roles/Permissions

In UNIX, a user's potential privileges of interaction with a given file are determined by permissions. If you are familiar with file permissions, you may have noticed that the evolution of the Web as I have framed it loosely follows UNIX's hierarchy of permissions: Read, Write, Execute.

> Here the first `-` indicates that this is a file, whereas a leading `d` would indicate that it is a directory. When we see an `r`, we know that read permissions are granted. A `w` grants permission to write, and a `x` grants permission to execute. The first triplet of `rwx` applies to the current user. The second triplet applies to that user's group. The third triplet is global, applies to all users.\*

> For example, a file that can only be read, written, and executed by the current user and no one else would have permissions set to `-rw-------` or in the numerical equivalent `700`, where user read permissions equal `400`, user write permissions equal `200`, and user execute permissions equal `100`. A file to be read and executed by anyone (like a file for the web), but only edited by the user would have permissions `755`, where the `700` is the same, with `40` and `10` added to grant group read and execute permissions, and `4` and `1` added to grant public read and execute permissions.\*

If you would like to dig deeper on UNIX file permissions, [here's a primer](http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/UNIXpermiss.htm). Acknowledging the read, write, execute hierarchy should suffice for our purposes, as we can see the web at large following the same staircase.
