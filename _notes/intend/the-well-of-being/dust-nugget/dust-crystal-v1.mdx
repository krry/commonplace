# Dust Nugget v1

at the beginning
we're a dust nugget
and so at the end

as seed becomes tree
becomes seed
as bird lays an egg
to crack around bird
so the nugget scatters dust
as every wave of light
to dance every dance
as it sings every song
until all rays entwine
in all ways become
one again
in the tightness of whirls
the eye sees itself
as the light it compiles

in between
we find all of us
in the midst of the dance
trees wave in the sun
as bees sing
flowers open
a bear rolls with its cubs
as snow melts into streams
flowing rivers into seas
who cloud up the skies
to send rain to the fields
for the trees and the flowers
buzzed by bees making berries
slurped by bears, chewed and swallowed
bountiful beauty
ripe for the kissbite
of the tiger stalk-tickler
the reindeer root-nibbler
the hare-brained hop-scribbler
and the rest of the zoo
