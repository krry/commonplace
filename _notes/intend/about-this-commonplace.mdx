# About this Commonplace

Commonplace is where I collect all the odds and ends, bits and bobs, and whatnot that haven't found their place in my [[projects]].

This is essentially a [[commonplace-book]] reimagined and retooled, arranged according to the [[zettelkasten]] method, built using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io) in VSCode, and published on Github Pages with a custom Jekyll theme. This "book" is structured roughly using the [[para]] method as described by Tiago Forte. It is also very much under construction. I have only just gotten the content together.

You might also characterize this as a [[digital-garden]]. Few Commonplaces have been kept in public like the digital gardens such as those Maggie Appleton curates. This is both. Here are the guiding tenets of this Commonplace

There is still much [[todo]] ⚗️

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[projects]: ../../projects "Projects"
[commonplace-book]: commonplace-book "Commonplace Book"
[zettelkasten]: zettelkasten "Zettelkasten"
[para]: ../../archives/roam/para "PARA method"
[digital-garden]: digital-garden "Digital Garden"
[todo]: todo "Todo"
