# 1. A Spire Shadow

Flames of our village
licked the moon and the high
spire beyond where eagles fly
spirals to sunrays at noontide 
helicas aloft in cloudbeams 
riding sighs of Earth and sky

Atop the towering mystery
a sitter on the spire still 
abiding winds unfathomed
a shadow on the moonface
whips a wizened beard 
whisking distant knowns to ears
 
Embers shoot to bokeh boughs
Gramma Mabel slows her waltz
elders sit with knees to ground 
brave young feet dash stamping 
ash tumbled from village fires past
fed by Mabel's fallen maple branches

Strummers drummers woods and winds
a poet hears from under growth
where fire meets forest and shadowsing
a melody wild to mooney notes
held close and howled
to bring the tribe in
dust-bathed chinchillas
with nothing to win 
only wells of hope 
they skip
digging in 
their sandcastle souls 
they dance in the wind

One dusty cluster
skirts the smoke
spouting divination
spinning a joke
this one knows love
and the gratitude within
surfs fear as it swells 
cries when it wins
to the spire fearless
young Sentima sings,
"No ledge too high.
No skies to wise.
I'll be where you sit.
Before the sunrise."
