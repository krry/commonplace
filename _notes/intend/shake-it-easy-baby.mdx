# Shake it Easy, Baby

If you've had a baby in the [[Great Allopathy]] in the last few decades, you probably know the five S's:

1. Shake
2. Shake
3. Shake
4. Shake
5. Shake

If you have a stomach for dogma you know that Dr. Karp and his team of care-simulating automatons would have us:

1. Swaddle
2. Side/stomach lie
3. Shush
4. Suck
5. Swing

If sure you can find more on this monotonous program of infant control mechanisms; ask anyone who worships at the altar of Snoo. For just $1500 you too can tie your baby down onto a Chinese-made robot to be jostled about like a tiny subway train for one, shushed by 14.4K baud modem singing one line of a song over and over. Its algorithms are carefully crafted to detect the slighest movement or utterances from your baby and confuse them into somnolent submission with their patented active awareness cancelling technology. You won't have to waste another minute listening to, learning to care for, bonding with, or soothing your baby. That's what robots are for, silly grown-up.

Now, even when the [[5 S's]] escape me at 4 a.m., even then I can remember the stark pamphlet the maternity ward sent home with us entitled "Never Shake Your Baby". An admonition like that tends to trigger the daredevil in me, a quality I already can see my son has inherited. He LOVES to be bobbled, jostled, jiggled, and wiggled. Only a very musical, elegant yet surprisingly vigorous shake will do. He will accept nothing less. There's a careful technique to it, but it's simple as can be and extrapolates to rather comprehensive program for caring for infants.

Anyway the pamphlet is rather clear. The inner portion is rather grotesque photo array of over-shaken babies or amorphous inert blobs of organic matter formerly known as babies I suppose. Definitely not going to republish it here. That went in the trash, not the recycling. Sorry Gaia, I know you understand.

Now to get the baby shake right, context is key, and practice makes perfect. But your baby is not a crash-test-dummy, so we'll need some supplies. Many of these supplies may be found around the house. You're going to want:

- a can of spray paint (any color will do)
- a bottle of viniagrette, preferably balsamic
- a can of Reddi-Whip dessert topping
- a warm bottle of kombucha
- a one-gallon ziploc bag full of equal parts ketchup and mustard
- a fifth of a gallon of vodka, one tray of ice cubes, and two cups
- 8 lbs. of potatoes in a burlap sack
- a snow globe
- a dashboard bobble-head doll
- and a coach, the louder and shriller, the better; ideally a dear friend, or your life partner.

The game is afoot! Your coach plays as the baby. Their objective is to get you to provide them with the objects from the list above properly shaken without using words, language, pointing or other gestures, coordinated motion of any kind, and without demonstrating the object or how to shake it. Notably, your shaking training buddy is permitted to make sounds, but each sound they utter must be louder and shriller than their last utterance.

Your task is to decipher the rising cacophony of heinous senseless screams emitting from your dear coach by choosing and shaking the items above until your coach accepts one and goes catatonic. Oh and no caps or lids. Whatever you shake has to be open. The snow globe and bobble-head doll may not have a way to open them. Don't fret. Just place them in strategic locations around the shake test site to help the participants and spectators get in a festive mood.

If you don't have a buddy who is willing to perform this absolutely vital, integral ritual with you, find me on Twitter @theRealProfBabyShaker. If I am already booked or you reside outside my jurisdiction, we will find you a suitable baby-shaking coach in your area.
