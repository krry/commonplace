# Dimensionality

## Perspectives on Dimensionality

- = 11D brane bulk
  - 6D micro
  - 4D macro
- ≤ 11D has consistent supergravity
- ≥ 11D symmetry maintained and compact space
- ≥ 7D manifold at each quantum point + 4D spacetime
- Kaluza-Klein 5D spacetime
- M-theory
  - branes hold energy as tension in embedded superstrings
- [[10-d-vision]]
