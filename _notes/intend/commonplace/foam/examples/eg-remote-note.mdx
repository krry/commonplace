# Remote MDX Note Example

This is generated from an MDX file that lives outside the `pages` directory of the NextJS app. We can use `next-mdx-remote` to pull in local files from anywhere in the tree, or files from a database or via an API.

MDX, of course, supports elements like `<Button>`this button`</Button>`, and ![this image of a lotus](/images/lotus.jpg).
