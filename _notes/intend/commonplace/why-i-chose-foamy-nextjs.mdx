# Why I Chose [[foamy-nextjs]]

Foamy-NextJS draws on three of my favorite [[toyls]]:

- [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io)
  - open, friendly, modular, conversational, markdown-centric, and hey, **_bubbles make [[foam]]_**!
  - out of all the multitudes of note graphs, [[zettelkasten]], and [[digital-garden]]s and [[second-brain]]s, Foam's approach to second braining was the best fit with my style and values. What not keep a list of all the tools I've given a go? [[second-brains-I-have-tried-and-left]]
- VSCode
  - super fast, rich, easy, extensible
  - I gave up Neovim for this
  - Between all the language servers, tabnine, eslint, prettier, standard, it pretty much writes my code for me.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
  - fast, versatile, and familiar. last but not least, I was already familiar if not marginally proficient with Next, thanks to their blog starter kit that I turned into [[Easeness]] - check it out at [Easeness.biz](https://easeness.biz). I was able to copy-paste my moonface themeswitch component and it worked in 15 seconds.
  - Next offers the best of both worlds: server-side static generation for lightning fast page loads and routing among the thousands of notes here, _and_ the dynamic, systematic flexibility of React Components, **and more!**
