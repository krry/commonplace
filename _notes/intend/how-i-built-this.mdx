# How I Built This

I first encountered the digital garden when I stumbled upon @yenly's [Notes to Self](https://til.yenly.wtf/notes/how-i-built-this). Eureka! It became immediately clear what I had to build. So when it came time to muster my courage and go public with all these crazy, incoherent ramblings, I dutifully tried a bunch of other approaches and avenues, and then eventually returned to the [[foamy-nextjs]] template for fast page loads thanks to SSG, and familiarity with NextJS. More on [[why-i-chose-foamy-nextjs]].

I've also kept track of the [[bumps-in-the-foamy-dev-trail]], which might be useful to others going this way.

Devsign-wise, the sunny color palettes are inspired by young son Zephyr. There are light and dark, sea and land themes so far. The switches for which run on a great lib `next-themes` that now replaces my handrolled moonface (which you can still flip off over at [Easeness](https://easeness.biz)).

The typography arrives via @fontsource which allows us to serve Google Fonts along with the payload of the site, and to fine-tune precisely which font files are sent. I use variable fonts to lighten the load.

### [[foam]] is great

- [Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes)

### Next was Now, kind of

- [Mastering Next](https://masteringnextjs.com/) - a brilliant (free) course from [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io) who also offers [React 2025](https://react2025.com/)
- [Learn NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
- [NextJS Examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples)

### Examples and Features

- [[eg-syntax-highlighting]] via Prism, which I rethemed with [Synthwave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode), which glows a blade runner's uvula
- image in markdown [[eg-excalidrawn]]
  - [[eg-next-image-component]]
- [[eg-numbered-footnotes]] in subfolder using remark footnotes
- [[eg-jsx-component-in-mdx]]
