# Dust Nugget v4

at the beginning
we're a nugget of dust
and so at the end

as seed becomes tree becomes seed
and as bird lays an egg
to crack around bird
so the nugget scatters dust
as every wave of light
to dance every dance
as it sings every song
until all rays entwine
in all ways become one
again in the tightest of whirls
and the eye sees itself
as the light it comprises

in between we find all of us
in the midst of the dance
trees wave in the sun
as bees sing flowers open
a bear rolls with its cubs
as the snow melts into streams
flowing to the rivers into seas
that cloud up the skies
to send rain to the fields
for the trees and the flowers
the bees berries and bears

and I sing some verses
make some steps of the dance
as do you and each being
each a dust cloud spinning
and each the dust nugget
spun out of the love
that conducts us to blow
apart and undone
till all dances are danced
and the songs are all sung

the notes hardly matter
waves crash on rocks
and the words lesser still
clouds need no bones
and the steps are our choices
paths wind as feet fall
creating order in our wake
no two are the same
though some can be fake

and our songs are all one song
and our dances one dance
no one stands alone
though we imagine we can

and imagine we can
any way where and when
from the biggest of bangs
to the tiniest tweet
from the seat of your being
where a caged bird sitting
sings ourself to sleep
to dream of being free
as it always will be

as a ray of light dances
any which way
it leaves behind a shadow
wherever it's been
So a hard ray leaves softness
and a warm ray leaves cold
As our anger yields a calmness
and sorrow allows for joy

From one nugget always
being all ways divides
into a twinverse reflection
a yin for each yang
high comes from low
near from far
out from inside

we put hands to a clock
work to tick out the beat
of our mother earth twirling
child moon in tow glowing
round our father sun beaming
gratitude
gratitude
gratitude each
and all playing
like flies in the streets
swirling in tandem
in the sweet cosmic breeze
on the updrafts of sidewalks
on the downfalls of traffic
in our souls and our feats

some steps feel awful
so that others feel wondrous
stub a toe on the coffee table
corner kick on the goal

and some steps are heinous
we can hit or can hug
pleasure makes room for pain
as good carves out evil
and fear shadows love.

when fear holds us tightly
we forget who we are
flailing into self
imposed isolate
confined solitaire

locked in illusion
we stride emto power
in chains of denial
we grasp for control
over others we seem to
sing and dance harm but
the pain we give rise to
comes back with revenge ants
to pillage our nervous ends

those who seem evil
are driven by fear
of not being enough
and not being at all

And since each of us
began and will end as a facet
on this dust nugget gem
that is us and has us
we can feel what it's like
to be any other dusty cluster
alone in its bubble
of fearsome madness

these lonesome bubbles
layer on and ossify
egoskeletons in the closet
where we blindly become
the monsters we fear
until one brave day
we tire of trembling
and crack the creaky door
of perception to peer
into the Mind at Large
with the eye beyond spacetime

the methods are manifold
We can pop the bubble all at once
or pick the lock breath by breath
We can stay inert and wait
until to dust we return
We can one-inch punch through
the coffin lid and terrified
claw back to rarefied air
screaming into the holy night
where shadows go to die

the fortunate daughters and sons
find themselves fully grown
still swimming in the dusty unknown
with no crimes to atone
for though the story of separation
can be a challenge to ignore
each choice remains yours
to maintain this All One God Faith
or wear the spectral mask
of your own personal wraith

as creativity accelerates
and the pace of novelty soars
then the scatter hits the brakes
bubbles fling open suicide doors
and the dust angels and devils
dance on the tarmac
and dance in the hills
and dance in the food desert
and sing from the rooftops
and sing in the trees
and play with the bears
and feed apples to bees

we sing our fears
out our anahata holes
to regrow the merry muscles
that have atrophied slowly
as we thought up technology
and treaded tired tropes
to distract from the void
the dust nugget calls home

we gather the bony shells
the cracked shards of egos
light a blaze for the ageless
a galaxy class tire fire
dancing in dust and as dust
with the full grace and gusto
all the love we can muster
till the clocks go nowhere
and work is ever over

wildflowers bloom
back into valleys
over hills where our hurry
had laid waste to the colors
of the fields of yesteryear
special invaders
from a world away borne on
leviathan tankers sped
by fossil fracking fuels

only tools could survive
in the bubbleverse to which
we had inadvertently subscribed
consentless as we came
here we remain hope
free
