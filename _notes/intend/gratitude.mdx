# Gratitude

## Thanks to Stephen Nixon and @ArrowType for [Recursive](https://recursive.design)

Today I'm especially grateful for this wonderful font, **Recursive**. It varies in _five axes_, and can animate along them, which is fucking objectively delightful. #fonts

### Thanks to Lorc, Delapouite and [the rest](https://game-icons.net/about.html#authors) for a wealth of weird Game Icons

[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons?name=gi) may as well be a bottomless pit.
