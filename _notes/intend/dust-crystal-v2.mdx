# Dust Nugget v2

At the beginning there was a nugget of dust.
And so at the end.
As seed becomes tree becomes seed,
and as a bird lays an egg to crack and reveal a bird,
so the nugget scatters its dust as every wave of light,
to dance every dance,
as it sings every song,
until all rays entwine,
in all ways become one,
again in the tightest of whirls,
and the eye sees itself
as the light it comprises.

In between we find all of us
in the midst of the dance.
Trees wave in the sun.
As bees sing, flowers open.
A bear rolls with its cubs,
as the snow melts into streams
flowing to the rivers into seas
that cloud up the skies
to send rain to the fields
for the trees and the flowers,
the bees, berries, and bears.

And I sing some verses,
make some steps of the dance,
as do you and each being
each a dust cloud spinning
and each the dust nugget spun
out of the love that conducts us
to blow apart and undone
till all dances are danced
and the songs are all sung.

The notes hardly matter
as waves crash on the rocks,
and the words lesser still—
the clouds need no bones—
and the steps are our choices:
the order we create,
no two are the same,
no one can be faked.

And our songs are all one song,
and our dances one dance.
No one stands alone
though we imagine we can.

And imagine we can
any way, where, and when
from the biggest of bangs
to the tiniest tweet
from the seat of your being
where a caged bird sits
singing itself to sleep
to dream of being free
as it always will be.

As a ray of light dances
any which way,
it leaves behind a shadow
wherever it's been.
So a hard ray leaves softness
and a warm ray leaves cold.
As our anger yields a calmness
and sorrow allows for joy.

From one nugget always,
being all ways divides
a yin for each yang
a twinverse reflection
high makes low, and near far—
an' out from inside.

We put hands to a clock
work to tick out the beat
of our mother earth twirling,
child moon in tow glowing
'round our father sun beaming
gratitude,
gratitude,
gratitude each
and all playing
like flies in the streets
swirling in tandem
in the sweet cosmic breeze:
on the updrafts of sidewalks,
on the downfalls of traffic,
in our souls and our feats.

Some steps feel awful
so that others feel wondrous
stub a toe on the coffee table
corner kick the winning goal.
And some steps are heinous
we can hit or we can hug
pleasure defines pain
as good is the absence of evil
and fear is being without love.

When fear holds us tightly
we forget who we are,
flailing into isolation
that we construe as separation.
Alone in illusion,
we strive for empowerment.
Imprisoned by denial,
we grasp for control.

We may sing and dance harm
upon what seem like others.
But the pain we give rise to
comes back with a vengeance.

Those who seem evil
are driven by fear
of not being enough
and not being at all.

And since each of us
began and will end as a facet
on this dust nugget gem
that is us and has us,
we can feel what it's like
to be any other dusty cluster
alone in its bubble
of fearsome madness.

These lonesome bubbles
layer on and ossify.
Egoskeletons in the closet
where we blindly become
the monsters we fear.
Until one brave day
we tire of trembling
and crack the creaky door
of perception to peer
into the Mind at Large
with the eye beyond spacetime.

The methods are manifold.
We can pop the bubble all at once
or pick the lock breath by breath.
We can stay inert and wait
until to dust we return.
We can one-inch punch through
the coffin lid and terrified
claw back to rarefied air
screaming into the holy night
where shadows go to die.

The fortunate daughters and sons
find themselves fully grown
still swimming in the dusty unknown
with no crimes to atone
for though the story of separation
can be a challenge to ignore
each choice remains yours
to maintain this All One God Faith
or wear the spectral mask
of your own personal wraith.

As creativity accelerates
and the pace of novelty soars
then the scatter hits the brakes.
Bubbles fling open suicide doors.
And the dust angels and devils
dance on the tarmac
and dance in the hills
and dance in the food desert
and dance on the
