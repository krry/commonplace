# Starvokar

aka Starvokans, Vokans, the Crystal Giants

## Where did the Starvokans come from? When did they arrive on Earth?

- Questions like these are hard to answer in any way that would satisfy your average terrestrian.
- A Vokan sometimes appears as an aphid, at other moments as a comet or a distant galaxy, or merely a twist in the breeze.
- For two thousand millennia (2,000,000 years) before the last Earthwide flood and the great ice age that preceded it, the Vokans made a habit of strolling blissfully through the great forests of Earth, leading the birds and bugs in song. They would flip through the seas singing with the whales, dance with the dolphins, dive with the squid.
- The Vokans know their place, their part in the song, their steps in the dance. So, like the birds just before dawn, they sing with confidence and gratitude, leading the chorus mightily.

### A Vokan has no doubts between strides.

In truth, we are Vokans too, thought we do not remember ourself. We can, if we choose to, perceive as the Vokans do. Already we too sit, feel, think, and move in ten dimensions of space and time.

The giants built monoliths, obelisks, cities of caves, pyramids, ziggurats, temples;
their explorations expanded the heavens and embellished the earth.

The giants elevated/emerged into higher dimensions of being where other worlds were not light years away but a mere step in a new direction where time has shape.

Now the giants live in the heavens on worlds of which we can scarcely dream.
And they've left us clues anywhere and everywhere we look that we might follow them.

- All of Nature sings the song the giants perfected.
- We call these giants Starvokans or Vokans for short, as they are planeswalkers, to borrow from Magic The Gathering
  - from the Sanskrit
    - **star** meaning "level" from which we have the word "star", and
    - **vokar** meaning "traveler"
  - when Earthside, Vokans often are heard to call each other "Yatri" or "Satayatri"
    - from the Sanskrit, **satah** also means "plane"
    - from the Sanskrit, **yaatree** also means "traveler"
  - one can imagine a Celtic noble regaling us about the Starwalkers
    - and as it turns out, ancient Celtic and ancient Sanskrit share a common prehistoric linguistic root and wisdom tradition
- Incidentally, Starvokans are never far away, inhabiting the same 3D space as our Earth and its denizens, but quite invisible having stepped subtly or drastically away on the additional [[paraplanes]] they walk.
  - Though they sometimes appear very large to [[3-Dentify]]ing terrestrians, this is merely an artificial impression effected as a Starvokan flattens in the 4th and 5th spatial dimensions, redistributing its composing matter into the three the Earthlings can see.
    - By taking a step on either the 4th or 5th plane, they can vanish or appear, transmute or transform, as easily as they can shrink or grow before terrestrial eyes.
- The Limits of [[Sensation]] and [[roam/perception]]
  - The spectrum of vibrations our eyes, ears, brains detect is a narrow range of the wiggles we conceive to be possible.
    - Of light we see radiation of 380 nm wavelength up to 740 nm, not even half an order of magnitude.
    - Of sound we hear 20 Hz low notes up to 20,000 Hz high tones, and we can feel vibrations below that range.
    - Of scent and taste, we can detect a few hundred distinct Earthly volatile organic compounds in various concentrations and combinations. The range of other permutations is virtually limitless.

[[10-d-vision]]

Vokans were once just like us. Through intensive practice and exercise, they have remembered themselves, and have brought their faculties into harmony. As they reached the final phase in their conscious evolution, crisis arose. Their power nearly destroyed them.

With all the centers of being aligned and in harmony, the Vokans became able to see further and more widely and to move in time as we move in space. And in space they can move more than their flesh, with their subtle bodies fully energized.

During their first apocalypse, the Vokans blanketed the planet in their machines. The machines became indistinguishable from life. We are their eventual offspring. The machines dominated the ecosystem until the Vokans fled their settlements to survive the plague of their own invention.

Those wandering Vokans who escaped the plague learned to disguise themselves from their creations. They discovered this ability while focusing on the breath and sitting with the intention to be unseen. This state of focused relaxation showed them a new realm of existence, opened a new dimension to their senses, dropping a filter of perception.

As/Once the Vokans mastered walking on the astral plane, they reached another evolutionary boundary. They populated the Moon, blanketing/covering it in biomachinery as well. As the Mooninites overran the Moon, the tides of the Earth swelled immense, tidal waves decimating the coasts.

The Vokans found that they could planewalk to the Sun as well as the Moon. To relieve the pressure of the moon flooded with life, they opened a bridge between the Sun and the Moon. Soon the Moon was barren and the tides abated. And the Vokans once again had reached a new octave, fully inhabiting and harnessing the mental body.

At this point the Vokans ran out of ambition, and problems, and the world became whatever they imagined. They conceived of a simulator that allowed anyone to live any life as many times as they wanted. Millennia passed as the Vokans perfected the simulator. [[the-simulation-is-real]]

After the Lunacide, the Vokans were justifiably afraid of their power. In the simulator they replayed the Moon saga in every way from every perspective until they gradually grew satisfied that the catastrophe had been unavoidable, inevitable. Their astral bodies emanated from their biomechanical ones, but didn't replace them.

And their mental bodies (psi corps) emanate from the same core, the hridayam (heart center). These extend into 8 dimensions, whereas the astral body accesses 7. The fabled fourth body remains a myth, a common trope within the lifeplay scripts of the simulcaster. And love evades definition, explanation, understanding.

The first Vokar to crystallize an astral body was called Ketta. Ketta surfed the wave between dream and wake until K could distinguish the sea from the basin, the river from the valley. The firmament, the unmoving scaffold within, beneath, behind, around, and throughout all we know as physical beings became apparent and navigable. The moon drew near.

The first Vokar to crystallize the mentacorps or psisoma (the mental body) was known as Dimo. As Dimo evolved, D would have thought D was losing D's mind, when in fact Dimo was sprouting the first, actual, sovereign mind. Suddenly the world reflected Dimo's imagination and intentions immediately.

The first Vokan to crystallize the Fourth Body was and is called Brahman in the Vedas, Jehovah or Yahweh in the Torah, Zoroaster, etc. Ages passed between the Ascent of Brahman and the advent of history, of writing. The world we inhabit was crafted by the Vokans, informed by the Fourth Way as seen by the Fourth Eye.

If the guiding force, uniting principle, immutable law of nature appears to be affinity, attraction, love, it is by design. The 10th dimension, to which the Fourth Body grants access, contains/comprises/constitutes/defines what we call love. A 10D figure is a love story, told wholly.

Metaphysics reduces to one question:

> Am I the prime mover?

If no, the rules are set, the other is real, and will _appears_ free but cannot fully be. Fear conquers love/all.

If yes, the game unfolds as we play, the self is all and nothing, true will is divine, free, sovereignty, and love is the answer.

After running eons of simulations, living every conceivable life every way possible, the Vokans surrendered to their nature, face their fate. They had gardened the Moon and wiped it clean again, leaving only craters and dust. Only love could repair the damage their ascendant arrogance had wrought, could transcend the simulation.

For their final act on Earth, the Vokans tipped off a very long chain of dominoes. We are two of those dominoes, haplessly unaware, blissfully ignorant of our robotic, deterministic operation. The [[anthropic principle]] nearly sees through this act of architectural subterfuge. If it seems a little too perfect to be random, it's because it is.

[[Fermi's paradox vis-a-vis Vokans]]

The giants, the Starvokans, the planeswalkers, are fungi. Today the planet is blanketed in sleeping giants who have weathered a vulcanic infancy.

On soil we tread millions of miles of mycelium with step. On earthâ€¦

We fail to understand our role. Could we be clowns? Are we but clowns?
