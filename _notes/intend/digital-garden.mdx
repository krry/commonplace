# Digital Garden

Where on the web one may plant seeds to see if they grow. The ideas presented in a digital garden are often raw and incomplete. They may not bear fruit. And they are not for sale, most of the time. A garden is kept for the joy of it, for the bliss of the grit.

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) has been instrumental in this exploration, curating [a garden of the digital gardening space](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), offering the story, and inspiring as a note-taker.

It was [Yenly](https://yenly.wtf) [whose garden](<(https://til.yenly.wtf)>) introduced me to the concept on [[2021-03-04]] and [[2021-03-05]].

Shawn @swyx Wang's [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/) may sound oxymoronic, but therein lies some sound sentiments. I'm sure [[easeness]] will eventually approach the policy of this digital second brain garden movement.
