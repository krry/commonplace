# Anthropic Principle

## Interpretations of the Anthropic Principle

1. Panpsychist - We did this to be here now.
2. Theological - Someone else did this so we could be here now.
3. Many worlds - We are unaware of realities that do not support our awareness, our worldview, our expectations. It's random. We're lucky.
4. Animism - No one did this. The All is Mind & Mind is All. Brahman's grand dream drama.
5. Vokan - The present moment is eternal and entire, encapsulated with all the necessary justifications and explanations.
6. The Cosmic Giggle - We exist to ask qusetions about the universe, existence, world.
