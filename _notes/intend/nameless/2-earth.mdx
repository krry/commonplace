### Musings

- Earth is square where heaven is round.
- Straight lines come from The Creative, but create the square of Earth.
- Midnight blue is the color of heaven.
- Yellow is the color of earth.
- Heaven and Earth collide when yin tries to lead. Lucifer rebels against God, a siege on Valhalla.
- A mare may lead by following impeccably.

### Hermagram

Judgment
The Receptive brings about sublime success

Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.
If the superior one undertakes something and tries to lead,
this one goes astray;
But if one follows, one finds guidance.
It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,
To forego friends in the east and north.
Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.
