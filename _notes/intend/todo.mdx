# Todo

- [x] [[frontmatter]]: capture and parse frontmatter as metadata for note templates
- [ ] tags: figure out how to make frontmatter tags and inline hashtags into links to those entitled notes
- [ ] backlinks: list backlinks on each note as footnotes
- [ ] auth!
  - [next-auth.js.org looks promising](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example)
  - [an example next-auth app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example)
  - could also use Magic or Firebase
- [ ] search
  - activate with `⌘p` or `⌘k` or `<Esc>` or `⌘f` or `/`
  - [a tutorial for setting up search in next.js](https://medium.com/@matswainson/building-a-search-component-for-your-next-js-markdown-blog-9e75e0e7d210)
  - [consider algolia, there's an example app]()
- [ ] PWA?
  - [an example Next PWA with Workbox](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/progressive-web-app)

## Bugs

## Feature

- [ding dong](https://commonplace.atmanaut.me/areas/poetry/ding-dong-the-dream-is-dead)

## Curate

- [ ] [[get-real]]
- [ ] [[poetry]]
- [ ] redistribute [[roam]] among the [[para]]
- [ ] [[resources]] - which are the key pieces? what do I move to areas or projects or archive?

## Done

- [x] figure out where to put the notes from [roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Atmanaut) that are in the [roam](./roam) folder
- [x] remove private docs before publishing via Github Pages
- [x] publish this to the commonplace repo
- [x] sync my todos here and on my phone somehow (using GitJournal app for Android)
- [x] answer [Gloria Lin's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vw3EKQ6mAU8vAqPjG2LY-YtCVLAIIfcvkaI08WKP4Iw/edit) [[50q-for-cofounders]]
- [x] decide between jekyll/gh-pages, gatsby/netlify, next/vercel for publishing (now using [[foamy-nextjs]])
- [x] `promise.then is not a function` on initial page load
- [x] links to nested docs are treated as absolute not relative

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[foamy-nextjs]: foamy-nextjs "Foamy NextJS Starter"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
