# note

this is example note about Islam's and Lea's guinea pigs: [[ohmu]][^1] and [[notan]][^2]. and now we keep talking about guinea pigs but in case you were curious about these names, you can look into them.

[^1]: [Ohmu](https://nausicaa.fandom.com/wiki/Ohmu) was a beastie in Nausicaa from Studio Ghibli.
[^2]: Means "light dark harmony". [Here is more on _notan_ from an art academy](https://drawpaintacademy.com/notan/).
