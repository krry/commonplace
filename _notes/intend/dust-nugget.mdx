# Dust Nugget

atop the spire sat a figure

we beginned
we biggened
until big end
to begin again

as seed becomes tree
becomes seed
as bird lays an egg
to crack around bird
so the nugget scatters
to dust as every wave
of light
to dance every dance
as it sings every song
until all rays entwine
in all ways become
one again
in tightness of whirls
eye sees itself
as light it
comprises
compiles

in between
we find yall of us
in midst of the dance

trees wave in the sun
as bees sing
flowers open
a bear rolls with its cubs
as snow melts into streams
flowing rivers to seas
who cloud up the skies
who send rain to the fields
for the trees and the flowers
bears berries and bees

and I rumble a verse
or these and I
stumble a dance
as do you and each being
dust clusters aloft
and each the dust nugget
spun out of love
that conducts us to blow
apart and undone
till all dances are danced
and songs are all sung

the notes hardly matter
waves crash on rocks
and the words lesser still
clouds need no bones or tassels
the steps are our choices
paths wind as feet fall
we extrude orders
into the wake
no two the same
though some can be fake

our songs are all one song
our dances one dance
no one stands alone
we imagine we can

any way where and when
from the biggest of bangs
to the tiniest tweet

from the seat of our being
where a caged bird sitting singing
ourself to sleep
to dream of being free
it always will be

a ray of light dances
any which way
leaves behind a shadow
wherever it's been
a hard ray leaves softness
a warm ray leaves cold
our anger yields calmness
our sorrow holds joy

from one nugget always
being all ways divides
twinverse reflections
yin is yang's eye
high comes from low
near from afar
dark and heavy from light
and out from inside

we put hands to a clock
work to tick the beat
of mother earth twirling
child moon in tow glowing
round father sun beaming
gratitude
gratitude
gratitude each
and all playing
like flies in the streets
swirling in tandem
in the sweet cosmic breeze
on the updrafts of sidewalks
on the downfalls of traffic
in our souls and our feats

some steps feel awful
so others feel wondrous
stubbed toe on coffee table
corner kicked in the goal

some steps are heinous
we can hit or can hug
pleasure houses pain
good carves out evil
fear shadows love

when fear holds us tightly
we forget who we are
flailing into self
imposed isolate
confined solitaire

locked in illusion
we stride emto power
in chains of denial
we grasp for control
over others we seem to
sing and dance harm but
the pain we give rise to
comes back with revenge ants
to pillage our nervous ends

those who seem evil
are driven by fear
of not being enough
and not being at all

and since each of us
began and will end as a facet
of this dust nugget gem
that is us and has us
we can feel what it's like
to be another
dusty cluster
alone in its bubble
of fearsome madness
floating prone
in the shower
drowning shallow
loner bubbles
layer on and ossify
egoskeletons in the closet
where we blindly become
the monsters we fear
until one brave day
tired of trembling
cracking creaky door
of perception to peer
into Mind at Large
eye beyond spacetime

methods are manifold
pop the bubble all at once
pick the lock breath by breath
stay inert and wait abated
until to dust we return
one-inch punch
through coffin lid
terrified claw
back to rarefied air
screaming into the holy night
where shadows go to die

the fortunate daughters
and sons find themselves
fully grown
still swimming
in the dusty
unknown with no crimes
to atone for though
the separation story
sticks wrong in your craw
each choice remains yours
to maintain this space
this All One God Faith
or wear the spectral mask
of your very own personal
instaface wraith

creativity accelerates
novelty pace soars
scatter hits brakes
bubbles fling open
suicide doors
dust angels and devils
dance on tarmac
dance in hills
dance in food desert
sing from rooftops
sing in trees
play with bears
feed apples to bees

we sing fears out
our anahata holes
regrow merry muscles
atrophied slowly
we thought up technology
treaded tired tropes
to distract from the void
the dust nugget calls home

we gather bony shells
cracked shards of egos
galaxy class tire fire
blaze for the ageless
we dance in/as dust
with full grace and gusto
all love we can muster
till clocks go nowhere
and work is ever over

wildflowers bloom
back into valleys
over hills where our hurry
had laid waste to colors
of fields of yesteryear
special invaders
world away
borne on
leviathan tankers
sped by
fossil fracking fuels

in bubbleverse
only tools survive
we inadvertently subscribed
consentless as we came
here we remain hope
free
