# Foam

There is a fantastic little open-source project called [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io) that helped me make this [[commonplace]]. It essentially turns VSCode into a Roam with some markdown magic.

## Bubbles make foam.

An as-yet-unwritten aspect of [[the-well-of-being]] will describe the fundamental structure of reality as foam. This model draws on the close-stacking algorithms developed by [[bucky-fuller]], 8-D symmetry groups and root systems, and the story of reunion wherein each sentient organism imprisoned within a membrane finds it can absorb and be absorbed, so many bubbles becoming foam.
