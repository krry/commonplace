# How to Case Links in a Commonplace

First I updated [[foam]] to make sure I have all the new goodness. Those cats are working hard to make this amazing. [[foamy-nextjs]]

For wikilinks, we want to be able to use natural casing and language in the link text, then convert that to kebab case for the url.

We also want to convert the filenames from anything they are into kebab case. Other symbols can become dashes.

Foam has made some rather opinionated decisions about link casing. It would seem that filenames need to be lower-kebab-case, and the wiki-links can be any casing to link within VSCode, but if you want the link reference to generate properly, those have to be lower-kebab too.
