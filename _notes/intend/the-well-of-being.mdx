# The Well of Being

We know all about the Well. It's in there, waiting at heart center, at the bottom of your soul, echoing what you know.

Here I am developing a multiverse of stories situated around the Well of Being.

The most developed story in this space so far tells us about [[ollie-and-the-well-of-being]]. [Here's a PDF of that](/docs/Ollie%20and%20the%20Well%20of%20Being.pdf).

Along the way, in [[anumaan-and-the-well-of-being]], we meet Anumaan, a goatherd in the Hindu Kush c. 44000 BP.

We also encounter [[fil-and-the-well-of-being]], and Hugo, Gracie, Trix, and, Quant.

The stories share [[well-of-being-characters]] and [[well-of-being-concepts]].

Previous drafts of Ollie's tale:

- [[the-well-of-being-v2]]
- [[the-well-of-being-v3]]

The creation myth in these 'verses is called [[dust-nugget]].
There have been previous iterations:

- [[dust-crystal-v1]]
- [[dust-crystal-v2]]
- [[dust-crystal-v3]]
- [[dust-crystal-v4]]

And there is more in the beat-up yellow notebook #toArchive and #toTranscribe.

There are many [[dust-nuggets-to-come]]. Khalil Gibran, anyone?

I'm particularly interested in the harmonics of evolution. We see them at play in [[systems-of-decimal-octave-evolution]] and in [[the-complexity-of-ancient-humanity]].
