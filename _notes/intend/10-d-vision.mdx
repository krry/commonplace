Drawing on the several centers of a person described by Gurdjieff to Ouspensky and Salzmann:

1. Being - entity
1. Instinct - identity
1. Moving - mobility
1. Feeling - sensitivity
1. Thinking - causality
1. Understanding - eternity
1. Knowing - entirety
1. Intending - intensity
1. Meaning - density
