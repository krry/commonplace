# Next Image Component

## Markdown image syntax

- Uses default options for `next/image` component.
- `next/image` requires absolute paths for src
- width and height is required
  - I set default dimensions, so `next/image` component won't throw an error, but it will distort your images if you don't provide image dimensions in the query string

```markdown
![Excalidrawn PNG](/images/excalidrawn.png?600x460)
```

**NOTE:** Markdown image syntax does not accept any other props in the query string.

## Custom JSX in MDX tag

Example using `next/image` component via custom JSX in MDX tag `<Image />`

<Image
	src='/images/excalidrawn.png'
	alt='Excalidrawn PNG'
	height='460'
	width='600'
	layout='responsive'
/>

```jsx
<Image
	src='/images/excalidrawn.png'
	alt='Excalidrawn PNG'
	height='460'
	width='600'
	layout='responsive'
/>
```

Following props are accepted and its defaults in `<Image />`

```javascript
let { src, alt, width = 600, height = 460, layout = 'intrinsic' } = props
```

**NOTE:** I decided not to support `layout='fill'` option because it's overly complicated for use in markdown content. I recommend importing `next/image` component and work with it directly since it requires wrapping a div container and tinkering with its style.

If you don't want your images to be aligned center, you can change CSS styling for `.nextImageWrapper` in global.css

If you want to customize your MDX components, you can find this code in `_app.js`

```javascript
import Image from '../components/Image'

const mdComponents = {
	a: props => <AnchorTag {...props} />,
	code: CodeBlock,
	img: props => (
		<div className='nextImageWrapper'>
			<Image {...props} />
		</div>
	),
	Image: props => (
		<div className='nextImageWrapper'>
			<Image {...props} />
		</div>
	),
}
```
