# Hyperbole - a museum for everyone

Nowadays we can build spaces that are not bound by gravity or hinged upon Newtonian notions of the physical world or on the strictures of material science. We can craft rooms without walls, and experiences without beginnings. Many of the greatest intellects of today search for our beginnings by chaotic disintegrations of the propelling the most intense energy they can muster into the smallest pieces of reality they can perceive. They may be seeking immortality through their endeavors to elucidate our collective origin. Who wouldn't want to see the face of God, if only for a moment?

There was a time when I aspired to devote my whole self and mind to figuring out where we came from, and where we might end up. I spent uncounted sleepless nights pondering the prospect of heaven, of eternity, of where my blissful childhood might lead me. "Be good," they would intone in every conceivable linguistic permutation. "Delay yourself gratification indefinitely!" I'm paraphrasing of course, but I took them as seriously as they took themselves.

As many of us did, I asked "why?" until they ran out of answers. And then I found someone else to ask.

"Why be good?"
"Why follow this set of rules?"
"To what end?"

No one could describe the end, or what comes after it. I feel ashamed, writing this now, that I avoid asking the question that most plagues and intrigues me to the people I hold near and dear. We've never known our ends, as far as I can tell. But that doesn't portend that we cannot come to know them.

Things got pretty hyperbolic when we realized that parallel lines don't exist, at least when we inhabit more than two dimensions. Sorry, Flatlanders: you're just shy of human. There is a line that stretches on forever in both directions, hypothetically. There is another point that does not lie upon that line. And there are more than one other lines that could pass through that disparate point that will never intersect with the original lines, as long as these lines and point exist in a place with more than two dimensions. Euclid grasped much, and distilled it famously, but even the least mathematically inclined intellects of our day comprehend more dimensions than those he strove to pin us within.

It occurs to me every day that we're (each of us) still coming to terms with this understanding. As obvious as our meaty, water-ballooned existences might make it, we defy it. We skirt around it. We shirk and dodge and juke the possibility that no two things can be eternally consistent. We virtually disintegrate at the thought that this is not merely a possibility. Rather, it is a universal truth, perhaps the only one.

# ∀ ≠ ∀

In so many symbols, **anything does not equal anything**. Nothing is
the same. I can't be the first sapient to grok this. Perhaps I'm even violating this absurd attempt at minting a universal truth to posit that any other mind has conceived that **everything** is new under, over, and without the sun.

## There are no two of the same

Every particle, object, vibration, molecule, galaxy, _et cetera ad infinitum_ differs from any of the others of their supposed type, or any other type. These words, movements, positions, expressions are new and unique. But they have been written elsewhere at a different time in a different place by a different hand on a different medium for a different reason, all the same. Paradoxically.

Perhaps I should steer to poetry where prose may fail me.

## Same cannot be

Our sensors fail us.
Catch a snowflake on your tongue.
As beautiful, unique, it is.

Caress a nape.
This one has never been touched.

Even as you taste this flake,
as you pet this, or stomp that,
or as you sniff a stagnant clutch,
it has already shifted.

Change has you.
You are changing.
Range reckless,
range widely and far.

But do not despair.
Don't pull away.
Same cannot comfort you.
A same simply cannot be.
Sames cannot be.
Nothing equals anything else.
No one else is you.
Nothing else is this.
Let it be, this too shall pass.

I'm no poet, though I claim to be a writer.
I sift through titles,
appellating instead of masturbating.
But I don't appellate. I am no apple.
Jobs didn't want a job.

I am a Snyder.
A Snyder is a Schneider dulled.
A _schneider_ cuts, slices through.
I bear the scars of incision far below my skin.
I grasp for other purposes while I could be embodying my own.
I hope you do not struggle this way.
My gently buried wounds bleed.
I cry for "us" far too often.
My Brita filter tires of me.
I watch its work spill on my shirt.

But there is comfort without equation, without question. Comfort in the question, comfort in equation.

I'd like to think there is **an answer**.
I've struggled to formulate a proper question.
Don't for a moment think I've ceased the struggle.
Any word I read pours through my metafilter.
Any vibration I perceive feeds first into that soulful maw.

It turns out to be simple.
It doesn't matter that nothing is equal.
It doesn't matter that sames are not.

What matters is quite opposite:
There is no equality.
And because of that everything is beautiful.

# Hyperbole: a museum for everyone

I've just reused that title. I barely remember writing it before, though only a few hours have passed. How can thoughts flood our minds for hours or years, or instead take flight?

Profound ideas don't like to stand around. They don't bother to swoop past mills, granaries, breweries, or distilleries. Our albatross truths soar through clouds dreamt by whales leagues below. The winds hold no meaning, but they carry it all.

## Short shrift:

A museum, as I've experienced it, can be a welcome space for a creative mind to express itself for a finite period of time during which absorbent minds can pass through that space.

Today we find ourselves in a certain situation.
_ We create more when we encounter unfamiliar vibrations.
_ We receive vibrations from sources increasingly farther/further off.
_ We manifest art by choosing a place, a time, a screen, and a speaker.
_ We encode our deepest secrets.
_ We record our most important notions.
_ We engrave our successes.
_ We can bend space and time by heating, then vibrating sand.
_ We can transmit messages in any direction.
