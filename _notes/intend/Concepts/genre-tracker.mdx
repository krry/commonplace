# How to keep track of future tracks

To catch the vibes of the future, you need a **sound net**. No vibe is too big or too small to change a life. To seduce the masses, a tapestry of sound must be a velvety weave bound with big bouncy fibers fringed with silky cilia. Big, middle, small all woven together imperceptibly, holding, swaddling, titillating.

***We're going to need a system.***

Off the cuff, it seems we'll want to attend to the waves themselves, as well as various classes of metadata that describe and interrelate them. The classes of metadata are innumerable, while the waves are raw, native.

## The waves

Knowing the waves is the key to catching the vibes. They defy names. They're not made of words. They're made of buzzes and blips, booms, bips, and baps. I think that means we get to call them whatever we want, as long as those names help us remember them, locate them, and reproduce them. Western musical notation immediately fails me when I attempt to intone the intergalactic dump truck with diarrhea bass drop in a track like [Skrillex' Dirty Vibe](https://youtu.be/Mq-aVCUs2Q0?t=54s). "Key of B flat, 5/8 time, ride the hats like Dr. Seuss, empty the boiler, heavy on the sour cream and onion." See? Nothing useful.

Instead, we must dissect them. We need a new vocabulary for twerk, for crunk, for bombdiggy. Something technical and accurate, but untethered from anything but the binary clicks of a couple hundred billion transistors waiting to pile-drive our souls for us. This will get messy before it clears up. We're heading for acneville.
