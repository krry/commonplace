title: Person Reaction Interest Matrix
---
# Person Reaction Interest MatrixSocialMatrix.prototype = {

A reaction can be emotional or interest-based.  We capture reactions by allowing users to upvote tags that closely resemble their reaction to the content.
Reactions may also have more than one person in context, for example when a user wishes to share his or her reaction to a GIF with another person.

Next GIF has the same [emo tag, interest tag, author] and the highest number of similarities with the current GIF within the person-reaction-interest-matrix
(PRIM).  PRIM tracks collisions of matrix factors for each GIF in the system. A collision may occur between 2 and n of the factors.

PRIM_factors = {gif, reaction, person, emotion, interest, person.reaction, reaction.person, reaction.interest, reaction.emotion, reaction.interest.person, reaction.emotion.person, person.emotion, person.interest}
