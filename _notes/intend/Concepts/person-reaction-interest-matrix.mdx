# Person Reaction Interest Matrix

A reaction can be emotional or interest-based.  We capture reactions by allowing users to upvote tags that closely resemble their reaction to the content.

Reactions may also have more than one person in context, for example when a user wishes to share his or her reaction to a GIF with another person.

Next GIF has the same [emo tag, interest tag, author] and the highest number of similarities with the current GIF within the person-reaction-interest-matrix (PRIM).

```js
SocialMatrix.prototype = {

const PRIM_factors = {
	gif,
	reaction: {
		person,
		interest: {person},
		emotion: {person}
	},
	person: {
		reaction,
		emotion,
		interest
	},
	emotion,
	interest,
}
```
## HUNH!?

PRIM tracks collisions of matrix factors for each GIF in the system. A collision may occur between 2 and n of the factors.

GIFs have views, and reactions, which have	emotions or interests and views.
