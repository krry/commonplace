# YesChef

YesChef would draw the Memphis food scene together and fuel its growth and success with foodies near and far by systematizing solutions and support for the common challenges and pain points of running a restaurant.

## Memphis has amazing food.

Memphis has some of the best food in the country, and is already recognized as the world's hub for BBQ. The world needs to eat here. [Let's get some Michelin stars in Memphis](https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurants?geoboundaries=34.9326674,-90.2410126:35.3448152,-89.7466278).

## Chefs should focus on cheffing.

Great chefs aren't necessarily interested or well-suited to handle the ancillary and administrative aspects of a restaurant, such as staffing, logistics, stock, ordering, accounting, payroll, menu layout/design, branding, marketing, PR, social media, and so on.

## Community drives growth and success.

The community can pool its resources and knowledge to help new and struggling (and all other) restauranteurs define and attain success. By investing attention and intent in each other restauranteurs can rise together and collaborate on a new story of Memphis' amazing food on the world stage.

## Learning together and teaching each other builds community.

We can condense and distill best practices for the ancillary aspects of running restaurants and offer:
- an initial bootcamp (YesChef 101)
- subsequent workshops on focused topics
- web-published supporting materials and streamable videos ([YesChef.kitchen](https://YesChef.kitchen))
- a meatspace community through regular meetups (EatUps)
- a cyberspace community through a moderated interest-based online chat and an FAQ platform (Back-of-House)

## Let the students guide the curriculum

We'll open a dialogue between the great restauranteurs of Memphis and beyond with new and struggling restauranteurs. The students' questions will shape the knowledge base, and the experts' answers will color it in. The role of YesChef is to initiate the dialogue, stimulate and support the community, and chronicle, distill, and publish the knowledge generated.

## First Memphis, then the world!

This program can be replicated in any restaurant community, and the web presence can be made accessible to anyone in the world to channel attention and revenue to the Memphis food scene. That's the vision anyway, and starting down the path will show us what plays out.
