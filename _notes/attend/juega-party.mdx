# Juega Party

¡Juega Para Ti!
We Gon' Party!
Work for no one.
Play for yourself.

Come play with us.
Dolo-a-gogo!
Look for the Wigpole.
¡Trae tus juegos!

Play for all ages.
Play for all tastes.
Play any time.
Play any place.

We offer the play
that you're missing
while you're working
for someone else.

What are we working for?
Are we getting played for this?
We don't accept payment.
We do accept gifts:
grown or made,
bought or earned,
in service of bliss.

Corazón primero.
Love inside out.
Gracias Abuela.
Te amamos.
