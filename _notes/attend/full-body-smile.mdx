# Full Body Smile

a dance school
where healers play
we are all in
hook a right
at the nook
of the bay

bring your dark pricklies
fresh pickles and rich dicks
flow from jam to breezy
freely chance upon
the space we hold
to play our way
to healed and helpful
lovers everyone and all

my eyes are like this
por que
I like what's near me
more than what is far
I can wear some lenses
or lope more swiftly
either way
I want you close
