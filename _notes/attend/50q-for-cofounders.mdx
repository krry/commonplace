# 50 Questions for Aspiring Founders to Ask Each Other

> adapted from [the Co-Founder Dating Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x7JYzvqw6Rlt4AZFzXm-XBVtWXDIn7WQFVUBoQfueFQ/edit?usp=sharing) [of Gloria Lin et al.](https://review.firstround.com/the-founder-dating-playbook-heres-the-process-i-used-to-find-my-co-founder)

## Part 0: How You Operate

### 1. What are your strengths and superpowers (beyond functional expertise)?

- Sight, deep inside and from very high up, to see how it all connects, how it flows.
- Equanimity, to relate to anybody.
- Radical empathy, to feel all the feels.
- Versatility, to learn the new skills.
- Wordsmithing, to forge the newer, truer story we need to start telling ourselves.

### 2. What are your weaknesses? How do you compensate for them?

- For pride, I take a daily dose of admitting my ignorance.
- For fear of success, I take one bolder move each day.
- For self-loathing, I daily resolve to improve.
- For money blindness, I take advice and direction.
- For contentment, I sit and grin.

### 3. What words would your co-workers use to describe you? What would they want me to know about what it‚Äôs like to work with you?

My friend and colleague Fiona once called me a polymath, to my face. I don't deserve such a mantle, but damn, what a compliment.

In amalgam, they'd probably confer on some mix of the nutty professor, monty python, don quixote, and dr. frankenstein. Or say I'm a know-it-all, but like really. Hopefully something delightfully left-handed.

### 4. How do you deal with conflict? Describe a time you dealt with it well ‚Äî and a time you didn‚Äôt.

I turn toward conflict, face it calmly. My core aim is to resolve tension as we reach a state of higher harmony.

It's hard to recall a situation in my recent life that has bubbled up into what we might agree was conflict. But then again, recently the conflict in my life has centered on the trust we societally place in allopathic medicine. From my point of view this trust is blind and harming us profoundly. I haven't figured out how to resolve this conflict. Sometimes I can hold space for the immense and manifold ambiguities we presently face, and sometimes I fail to do so and pick a side.

### 5. What‚Äôs the worst interpersonal conflict you‚Äôve dealt with? How did you handle it?

When I met Brogan and the founders-to-be of Arrivo, they were barely on the other side of a half-billion dollar lawsuit in the wake of Hyperloop One going sideways. I listened to them, let them vent, offered them creative avenues to move on, and supported them however I could. We had to navigate choppy waters frought with litigation and egomaniacal flame wars. And we made it out, made a new company, raised $10M, and built a stellar team of 40 in under a year.

### 6. How do you cope with stress? Depression? Are there any red flags I can help watch out for?

Stress results from attachment to outcomes unachieved. I remain flexible and free-floating to avoid stress. When I choose attachments and make agreements, I do so with great care so as to avoid undue distress.

Depression is anger grown stale. Expressing anger healthily can prevent that.

If I seem stuck, or antsy, or volcanic, you can give me pause (or paws üëê) and ask an open-ended "What's up?"

### 7. How do you arrive at your convictions? What are some key mental models you use to be creative, solve problems, or make decisions?

I love to dig deeper. Are you familiar with Isaiah Berlin's Fox and Hedgehog? I embody the hedgehog most of the time, searching for the one full truth, seeking unity, clarity, harmony.

I've got a quippy little motto that I really like: "Always be asking." Self-enquiry, especially following Sri Ramana Maharshi, is an extraordinarily powerful mode of being. Always asking reminds me to establish consent before taking actions that impact anyone. Always asking reminds me that ignorance outpaces knowledge.

To make sense of the big waves, I often turn to the Tao Te Ching and the [Yijing](https://nameless.easeness.biz). I am continually amazed at the clarity of vision to be found between breaths.

### 8. Describe your work style. What techniques do you use for personal productivity?

I aim for flow. I flow best when sitting still, or when writing what I know, or brainstorming what I don't know. I make decisions easily and quickly, addressing fears, openly fielding objections.

I take the work out of work. Anything I notice repeating, I try to automate. Anything I don't understand, I try to learn. Anything that frustrates me, I breathe into.

The best interface is no interface. I continually try out new tools, and only keep a treasured few with me. And I sharpen the axe more than I swing it.

### 9. How many hours/week are you willing to work? For how long? What sounds good? What sounds like hell? Do you have different expectations for different phases of the company‚Äôs lifespan? (i.e. willing to work harder in the beginning)

I can be responsible for work all the time, as long as a delay in response is acceptable. Deadlines aren't for the living. I make my agreements carefully, and I keep my agreements.

I can and will devote up to 10 hours a day to work when needed. And when not needed, I will use that time for family and well-being. I go with the flow and rise to what we need.

Hell is poorly made agreements: too many and ones I can't keep. If we are careful about what we agree to, our responsibilities will be manageable and acceptable.

I find that expectations breed disappointment and little else, so I try to leave those aside. Historically, I show up whenever I am needed, and lead by example. This will continue to be the case.

## Part I: Roles

### 10. What would you want your role to be before we reach product/market fit? What would you want your role to be after we reach product/market fit?

I like to be in the skunkworks. R&D. Ideation. Devsign. Prototyping.

Before we find our market and our fit, I want my role to be focused on finding our market and our fit by the easiest, most graceful means possible.

After we find a fit, we may need to begin to anticipate the response of the market and our nascent competitors. As V1 takes off, I want to focus on envisioning V2.

### 11. How do you see your role changing as the company starts to scale? (Read this article giving away your Legos.)

As the company scales I may build less and listen more. No Lego is sacred to me. Historically I take on and learn whichever role the org needs filled. I would love to build a team of wunderkinder and whippersnappers and steward their brilliance, breakthroughs, and successes using radical honesty, deep listening, and heart-first design.

### 12. If your role becomes unavailable entirely (e.g. the board hires a professional CEO or an experienced executive), what would you want your new role to be?

CXO? Your friendly neighborhood Kerrbear? I'm not concerned with titles or roles.

> The name you can say isn't the real name. ‚Äî Tao Te Ching ¬ß1

### 13. Areas of Responsibility (AoR) Exercise. Rank yourself in these areas (both as an individual contributor, and as a leader) on a scale of 1-10. Then rate your passion in each of the above areas on a scale of none to high. (e.g. ‚ÄúI'm an 8 in sales, but hate it so none‚Äù):

| Realm            | Builder | Leader | Passion |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| Sales            | 5       | 7      | 6       |
| Marketing        | 7       | 9      | 9       |
| Product Strategy | 7       | 9      | 9       |
| Design           | 9       | 9      | 9       |
| Engineering      | 9       | 7      | 9       |
| Operations       | 6       | 7      | 6       |
| Fundraising      | 6       | 6      | 6       |
| Leadership       | 9       | 7      | 8       |
| Company Building | 6       | 7      | 8       |
| Recruiting       | 7       | 9      | 9       |
| Legal            | 2       | 4      | 2       |
| Domain Skills^   | ?       | ?      | ?       |

^ Domain or technology-specific skills (e.g. Healthcare, Machine Learning, etc.)
Cluster AORs based on rank and discuss how they could be assigned to individuals. (E.g. John is a 10 in product, so he gets that AOR).

Break ties using the passion rating. (E.g. Nick is a 7 in sales with medium passion and Gloria is a 7 in Sales with high passion, so Gloria will take on sales).

Discuss: Do these clusters align with everyone‚Äôs expectations, skills, and desires? Do we all agree on the areas of responsibility for the CEO, CTO, COO, etc?

## Part II. Corporate Structure and Funding

### 14. Where should our startup be based? How do you feel about remote or distributed teams?

In a timezone with nice weather and fresh food. Rhythm is important. Starting in PST makes sense because I'm/we're here now.

Remote/distributed/decentralized teams are the future (and the present). Maybe Hawaii? Costa Rica?

### 15. Is there anything I should know that may affect materially affect your time or legal status as a founder? (e.g. visa, green card, criminal record)

Nope.

### 16. How should founder equity be set? What‚Äôs your philosophy on the employee equity pool?

Even steven. Employee with ownership invest themselves. More self-investment is better.

### 17. What should our approach to employee compensation be, including cash and equity?

I like how Change.org does it: transparent compensation. Every employee knows what the others make and their stake. Gives us a strong incentive to make good deals and avoid favortism or any other -ism.

### 18. How much money should we raise? (i.e. ‚Äúzero‚Äù to ‚Äúas much as we can‚Äù) In the range of ‚Äúbootstrapped small business‚Äù to ‚Äúgo big or go home‚Äù, where do you want this startup to go?

Enough to grow 20x this year.

As much as possible without poisoning our well or relinquishing the reins. A healthy cushion to hire a well-rounded, super-talented team and start building something rad.

### 19. What matters most in a funder? If you were doing reference checks on a VC or potential board member, what traits would you be looking for?

Ease. One who doesn't hurry. Accessibility over security. High risk, low ego. I'd ask Kyle Wild and Nancy Hua and a small cadre of founders I trust for reads.

### 20. What does an ideal company exit look like to you? (i.e. ‚Äúwork on company for 1-2 years and sell for 7 figures‚Äù to ‚Äúwork for 10+ years, reach 9 figures in revenue, and IPO‚Äù)

Four year cycles seem to be common in our culture. Seems like a smart way to phase our goals. Personally I want to set my small family (my partner and newborn son) up for thrival. An ideal company exit brings a bunch of people in, and up, and leaves everyone better off. I think we exit before we are tired of the space, or tired of each other.

### 21. How do you think about the timeframe and pace of success? Are you willing to take the longer path? How long is too long?

Success does not sit at a finish line. It is a way of being. The path is infinite.

That said, my primary objective is bliss. So if I'm not enjoying myself, I'm not successful.

### 22. What number would you sell at? How would that change if you got extra liquidity from your existing positions?

F-U-money. Yes, maybe, if we're tired of it.

### 23. What do we do if we find product/market fit, yet none of the founders are excited about that product?

Sell and start over. Get out and move on. It's about the joy of making magic.

### 24. Can one co-founder fire another co-founder? Can someone else fire a founder?

Yes and no. If the goal is harmony, then violent, unilateral actions will not serve us. But if near-term harmony is impossible, fire we must.

## Part III. Personal Motivation

### 25. Why do you want to start a company ‚Äî in general, and in particular right now?

Because now is the time. I am ready. And the world needs my gifts.

In particular, as ecological and economic crises collide and businesses fail, we will need a new model for organizations that aim for harmony, that prioritize well-being over doing good, happiness over progress, who act with love rather than out of fear.

### 26. What is success to you? What motivates you personally?

Success is enjoying oneself. It is an ocean of flow states. I am driven mainly by curiosity.

### 27. What impact do you want to have? Is your startup objective ‚Äúgetting rich‚Äù or ‚Äúchanging the world‚Äù? Is control or success more important? (i.e. Are you willing to step aside if the company is more likely to have a financially successful outcome or is it important for the founders to stay in control of the company‚Äôs destiny?)

Between control or success, I choose success, as defined above. The goal is to build something amazing and magical, something that brings people together who wonder what is worth doing. I'll not stand in the way of amazement or magic, but it's really hard to stand by and watch them kill your baby.

### 28. What makes you gritty?

Genetics? My grandmother was gritty. Won multiple medals in the Senior Olympics after a quadruple bypass and a bout with cancer.

Ten quiet minutes alone makes me gritty in the short term. A close brush with death also does the trick.

### 29. Who do you admire most in your organization/family/friends and why?

At the moment, my month-old son Zephyr Bear has my admiration. I'm realizing in this early moments of fatherhood that nature reveres its young and discards or digests the old. Many human cultures would have us revere the old, decrepit, or deceased. But is it any honor to have lived a long life? Or does the honor lie in the new try?

### 30. What are you most proud of in your work career or life to date?

Again, I have to say my newborn son.

Recently I built [Nameless](https://nameless.easeness.biz), which is still in alpha, but I'm very pleased with it.

Careerwise I feel that pride is better placed in the future than the past.

### 31. When have you taken a chance when others did not? Or when have you been willing to take an unpopular stance?

It's kind of my M.O. to take unpopular stances. For reference, see [Easeness](https://easeness.business), or [Atmanaut](https://atmanaut.me).

### 32. What are some of the products and companies you love, and why?

I'm really inspired by crafts, art, and products that represent a lifetime of careful practice and expertise.

I look for products that enable the creativity, vitality, or serendipity of their customers.

I love Mom and Pop shops, co-ops, endeavors in rewilding and regardening, links in the farm-to-table supply chains, and dev shops and open source projects that make web and app magic.

The companies I love fit the description of an [Easeness](https://easeness.biz).

### 33. Is it possible to build a wildly successful company without burning out or damaging other parts of your life (family, health, etc.)?

Yup. Let's do it.

## Part IV. Commitment & Finances

### 34. Will this company be your primary activity? Do you have any other time commitments?

Family first. Then this company. My time is otherwise my own.

### 35. What is your expected time commitment right now? How do you see that changing in the next 6 months? 2 years?

Right now I can be there whenever the baby is all good, which is most of the time, but somewhat sporadic. In 6 months, I will be more available more regularly. In 2 years, when Pandemic 3: Return of the Fauci comes out, who knows what we'll be up to.

### 36. What is your personal runway? Current burn rate? Would you invest your own money (ideally retaining higher equity in return)?

I'm currently bootstrapping my consultancy, so not as long as I would like. But I'm willing to lean in how I can, or prop up as needed.

### 37. What is the minimum monthly salary you need to survive? To be comfortable? To feel like you‚Äôve ‚Äúmade it?‚Äù

Survival rate is of course nil, we can find a way. $10K a month barely pays our bills. Twice that would feel nice.

### 38. What should the policy of co-founders advising/consulting with other companies be?

It makes a village.

## Part V. Team Culture

### 39. Complete the sentence: It would make you proud to hear people describe this company‚Äôs culture as _blank_. (Values are written words, and your culture is how you actually live those written words.)

Brobdingnagian. [fhqwhgads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ceGeTD1PN4). ZEF to DEF.

Workfree. Playful and fun. Focused on well-being. Wholesomely orgasmic.

### 40. What‚Äôs your philosophy on how to attract and retain great people? Tactically, how would we make this happen at our company?

I want everyone we bring onboard to be able to outperform us at their job. We'll build the pyramid upside down.

We can employ radical honesty, courageous positivity, and the power of vulnerability to attract and retain great people.

### 41. What processes or techniques would you use to get the most out of your team? For example, how would you help them become better managers or achieve their goals?

Plenty of rest and [sleep](https://www.stack.com/a/lebron-james-reveals-his-secret-for-superhuman-sleep). Deep listening. Meals together, and quality time. Regular, casual, personal conversations. Circling. Publishing our goals and resolutions, quarterly, yearly, longer term. Sharing responsibilities.

### 42. How much of your time do you hope to spend either working or socializing with coworkers?

0 to 60 hours a week depending on the week. 40ish weeks a year.

### 43. How important is diversity & inclusion? Concretely, how would you put that into action?

Resilience arises in the presence of diversity which follows from the practice of inclusion. So they are paramount for the continuance of an effort or organization through unpredictable conditions.

To build a strong team, we look for a wide and balanced array of complementary strengths, perspectives, and backgrounds.

Everyone may choose and dictate the facets of their own identity. These are acknowledged, respected, and inconsequential at the company.

## Part VI. Co-Founder Relationship

### 44. Specifically, how are we going to prioritize and make time for our co-founder relationship as we get increasingly busy with company building?

Ritual. We'll set regular time aside to hold space for each other, to listen, to create. We'll develop and share our rituals with the team. We'll grab a beer.

### 45. How would we resolve personal conflict between ourselves? How about stalemates?

Draw straws? Introducing a random decider can elucidate the sticking point.
Darts? Something simple, playful, and competitive can help to break the tension.
Call on our elders, our advisors, the [oracle](https://nameless.easeness.biz).

### 46. In case this becomes part of our partnership‚Äôs evolution, how would you go about handling a startup divorce?

Swiftly, graciously, as the ocean guides the tide back to sea. We split the kids down the middle. jk

### 47. What happens in the scenario where we aren‚Äôt growing? How would we diagnose the problem? How have each of our capabilities and approach contributed to growth failures in our pasts?

We ask whether we need to grow.
We look at the market, the competitive landscape, our product(s).
Failures to grow in my past may have stemmed from an over-focus on integrity, aka not selling out.

### 48. In every partnership, there are times when a partner might breed resentment if certain dissatisfactions don‚Äôt change over time. How would you deal with a situation like this?

Paintball combat. Or maybe a jousting tournament.

### 49. How would you think about bringing on a third (or N+1) cofounder?

I would think laterally about it. It's nice to have a little overlap in expertise as long as we don't become homogenous.

### 50. Wrap up question: Now we know each other's weaknesses, passions, needs and constraints‚Äì‚Äìhow are we going to make each other successful? What would it take to feel truly partnered in this adventure?

What are we getting tattooed?
