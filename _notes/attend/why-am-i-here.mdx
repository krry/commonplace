title: Why Am I Here
---
# Why Am I Here## Why am I here?

So you have learned that you got here because your parents made a baby and that baby is you. You wonder if this is the meaning of life: baby-making. This is as good a guess as any, or so it seems. Who can argue against building a strong family with love and enough money for safety, food, warmth?

Our old friend "Why?" begs to be asked. Why make babies? We can now appeal to our most polymathic anthropologist/historian/sociologist/cosmologist/politico-ethicist/quantum physicist. Humans are the most highly evolved form of life known to exist, and the physical universe tends toward disorder and disarray. If entropy is increasing, and maximum entropy means heat death and the end of everything, and life is the only known force that can slow down entropy, then it is our supreme objective to create as much life as possible and disseminate it into the cosmos.
