# Yes Chef

We're on a boat and
we're trolling slow an
we've got a *bonne* to *soirée*
pass me the *rosè*.

The spice closes two
then opens three eyes.

Have Love
Will Travel

Lay in a cause for celebration.
Mark the center of affinity.
Set intent to "wanderwith".
Bonjour santé
santé santé santé
bon soiré.

Hear ye Muses,
Hear ye Hustlers,
Mystics, Monarchs,
Pioneers, Players.

L'Imperatrice
et le Bateleur
become the Bard,
like two Cats in the Wild.

We'll start at the Drain
and spiral our way back up
to where the bacon sizzles
along the middle coast.

What are we cooking up next?
