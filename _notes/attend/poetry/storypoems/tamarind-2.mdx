# An Ode to Tamarind  

We found ourselves on Tamarind  
drawn by friendly, sharky fins.  
A polar bear to guard the floor,  
the Mayor left akimbo the door.

Kellydawn, Katie (small 'd', no space)  
propped the enchanted gate askew.  
Her sidelong smile rang out true:  
family lived here, new old friends too.

We nestled into the guest bedroom,  
strang festive lights and banged through the night,  
held court on the patio, praised passers-by.  
We marveled at their warmth
at their breadth of "Why?"

# Characters

Miss Anna walked her dog, her neck in a brace.  
Sir Lawrence took her arm, keeping her pace.  
Phil jangled out hope, hunkered down in a cove.  
Dennis snapped off shots in search of a trove.

Lawrence warmed our souls.
Phil rang in the new olds.
Tracy's now loves the sun.
Anna's neck brace is shunned.

Tracy dons tights most the time, as do I.  
We don't have it easy, but we grin and we cry.  
I once caught her Ricky.
Rick caught me by surprise  
when he asked for a hand
in trade for humble pie.
Pootie Tang was my jam.
Then I found out he ran
with CK, Maron, Conan.
An Angry Poet, perhaps, who'd sucked dick for heroin,
but we all need help across the street now and then.

A floor up on the balcony they shot dice until dawn:  
rattle, rattle, splatter, otherworldly patter.  
Till we'd locked ourselves out, adrift on the lawn,  
and their 2am rescue salved our *faux pas* qualm.

Meanwhile P. Bear drifts away on an Elysian glacier.  
He could really cut a rug,
really tied the *room* together.  
We sense his absence deeply;
I applauded his tap dances, held him dear, petted infrequently.

Corrin spoke the Queen's, towered regally, walked the dog,  
drew a mob to **nom** curry, downstage an Elvis Thai.
Muhammed trained his lil' bitch
with patience, calm sighs.  
He slept a little, filmed hard:  
serenity now, passion high.

Rigby ran loops around anyone nearby.  
Mark sang his praises.  
Rig's feet fleet raised hands high.  
Kellydawn said no 'NO's,  
taught us how to say 'Hi!'.  
("How do we make friends? We say "Hello!")  
Then Rigs walked the grownups,  
and the neighborhood remained tied.

# Essences

The dogs stoop to waft Ol' P. Bear's memoirs,  
Stories left untold, but enturfed,
written roadside in the dirt.
Los Angeles de los Franklin: such *haute*, so "hi" all the time.  
Ol' PBear hustled hard,
defined his hood and his yard.

And now I give pause,  
I look north to the hills.  
My familiar-tree flits  
and thrives in the winds.  
Then the garbage man cometh:  
Arma-dumpster-fucking-geddon.
So that's why pigeons shit themselves!  
Often wondered, now it's present.

"Let's try another option."  
"Can we do something different?"  
"What else could we do?"  
"I dig your moxy; but cigars are for closers."

That last one was me,  
and the others paraphrases.  
All I mean to say's is  
I've learned volumes in these dayses.  

I took Vinyl Communion here  
after a dozen fitful years.  
It spun from a black wafer  
sang a sermon for our ears.

Scott exorcised demons from Lou Reed's Transformation.  
We reveled in his telling of angelic indignation.  
I sat spellbound on a stool  
drinking wisdom I had missed
less Snapchat, more Velvet  
underground. Give your spirit a kiss.

A debate once sprang out,  
all from the same side.  
It turns out we're all feminists:  
Shelby, Ourhay, and I.

The Goddess once reigned  
and we'll raise her again.  
Trump's card is played out,  
Hill's cresting their bout.

# Tributes

Shelby, our Mayor, our savior and host  
he leavens our spirits,  
bakes muffins, roasts potatoes,  
sprouts friendships, bakes loafs.  
He doesn't toast, wouldn't boast,  
but he's a star shining through  
those angels fallen smog,
through their shroud of false.

We can't be all present, all gift, all the time,  
but Shelby is on it, long shrift, no rewind.

I couldn't be more grateful for my time on Tamarind  
with all these mindful, wondrous, extraordinary humans,
with all these characters sublime:
*Los Angeles* soaring in the hill-bottom wind.

# Other takes on Franklin

An aside from ago, askance, and down under,  
we sowed our wild oats as we surfaced from asunder:  
we cooked rice with Kely Lyons  
while Bill ran with *coyotes*.  
Gerald manifested Mother's demons
Marisol heaved his dreams of cretins.

I remember the stars, nebulous and forming.  
I remember Justin Long: sauced, prostrate, and foaming.  
I remember *le trashcan* --- or something Fran√ßais --- 
and that tempering chill of the Oak Gourmet.

First day in town I got stopped by a crew
Filming an empty nester's street interviews.
"Have you seen our son?" I had, Shane Carruth, he resembled.
I strolled on, folding their flier as I reassembled.

Gelson's fed us well, each checker a *courtesan*.  
At Local a meatless reuben met my tongue, heart, and lapband.
The Birds roosted flocks of drunk, sloppy seagulls  
to the thrill of Pork Munchies, just as sloshed, not as regal.

Franklin and Co.: thanks for housing our strife  
and feeding our habits in the powerful wake  
of one intensely inimitable,
inexorable ex-wife,  
whom I espouse and enamor with all of my life.

Which brings me to Ourhay,  
the other 'I' in my 'we'  
She sponsored this saga,  
she sanctioned its speech.
She piloted us into and through this fair City
always under fire,
always amidst siege.

We fled to Ol' Frisco by the Bay for a stretch.  
But the winds were too misty,  
the bro-dawgs too techy.  
The tap-water, though fresh,  
a mite too Hetch Hetchy.

So we rang our return to SoCal for the 4th  
with Chicago orchestral at the Hollywood Bowl.  
Then downtown on a rooftop  
we watched LA pop off,  
like God clutching sparklers  
for miles, in droves.

The conclusion you might seek hasn't yet risen.  
Instead we're nesting north of the Arts District sprawl.  
Yes, we're artists! Just like you. Aren't we all?

LA is so big and wide, and awfully girthy, agreed? 
Paved with concrete velvet, sometimes gritty, sometimes sleek.

Long live Franklin, Delano, Benjamin, et cetera.  
Long live Tamamind, you're the root of LA's soul.  
Cheers to the Mayor, to Kd, to Poubelle and flies.  
We'll traipse through with pride having spread Tamarind's thighs.

***P.S.***
Hail Xenu, out with Thetans.
Are we now Scientologists without submission to a reading?
I'm asking for a friend, she's stricken with intrigue.
We feel the same, also richer,
leveled up and some change.
