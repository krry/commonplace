title: Shes Leaving
---
# Shes LeavingSometimes I feel I want to run away
But I always stop and stay
Looks like I’ll give it another day
It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay
But the Cheshire cat won’t leave me alone
Why won’t she call, guess I’ll wait by the phone
Don’t get me wrong, believe me I know
I’m just a little bit selfish and scared that you’ll go
