# Paul Selig To ElysaA leotard for me would be a heleo

🙂 I have an idea for a harmony experience that draws like a spirograph, sounds like a theremin, and lets people swing on pendulums (pendula?) to make the art

So this superfly
food truck rumbles up
and it goes like 🎵🎶
tacoburgerpizzaicecreamsandwich
and then a 🌊 of wonka fog
catches up with it
washes over me and you

we bob in its wake adrift
in hawaiian ice mist
for our skin sun-kissed
on tongues awag
from mouths agape

I don't think you're a good boy

Just a typical run-of-the-mill boymanbearhorseowlion

SMS may be async
but ESP is FTL

any beach will do
black sand, white sand, blue
skies drenching coconuts
palms
wave
massage
island blossom essences
onto sun-kissed
dorsals, fins, flippers
lips greet body heat
naughty dolphins
remora clean

I remember burying
my face in your nape
only hours ago
and catching a whiff
of why winds blow

But my skin still echoes with your smooth soothe and your firm yearn

As the placid lake
welcomes the quicksilver moon
I've pooled for you.
