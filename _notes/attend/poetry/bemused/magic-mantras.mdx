# Magic mantras

I do what feels right.
I put love first.
We love to travel together.
Happy together follows happy alone.
Quiet mind, fertile field.
We can only inspire.
Where will we come next?
Where we next will come.
Take care of your self.
Resolve into beauty.
Come before you go.
Better off with less.
Gather your belongings.
