# No Fear

From _Dune_, the "Litany Against Fear":

> I must not fear.

> Fear is the mind-killer.

> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

> I will face my fear.

> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

> Only I will remain.

Frank Herbert was a heck of a novelist, but this poem leaves much to be desired. Perhaps we could recite it more tersely, with rhythm.

```sh
Fear be gone.
Slay my mind,
slow my roll
no more, fear.

My eyes wide
pierce my fear.
Let this pass.
I will stay.
```
