# Selfish

autonomous
self lawed
autocratic
self powered
automatic
self moved

Assumptions three
that needs might meet
laws, power, motion

The latter suredly
the formers nerf herdedly

we can
say it with me
out loud
not quiet
we CAN
WE CAN!
herd nerf
surely surf
without attending to who rules whom or lies in the lurch

we can
sit and breathe
hold
space on in and around us
on in and around you
who we are
we with whom you have found embodiment
our assembly of farty tacos
oily folds
tubes of floopy bloobs
gloopy moobs
stuebenville portajohnsonville bratswurst

I listen to Patsy Cline everywhere
