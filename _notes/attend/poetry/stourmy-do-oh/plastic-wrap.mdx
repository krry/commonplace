# Plastic Wrap

Call me Ishmael.
I've wrestled a pale beast.
These hydrocarbons shed a poor sheen
on the filth I'd have come clean.

Plastic wrap,
call this a rap,
let's call it a wrap.

Decades ago I started wondering
what this stuff was for: this film we leave
space with, between our food
and itself, between our food
and its maker.

Why do we wrap so hard?
Why do we wrap so tightly
the stuffs that we get from our supermarket
trucked in daily,
flown in nightly?

This plastic wrap.

Are we stopping time,
are we leaving it plastic?
Preserving rinds,
stopping time?
