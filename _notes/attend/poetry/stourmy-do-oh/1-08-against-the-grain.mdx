## Track 8
# Against the grain

We've given up, in no ways than one.  
We've sliced it up against the grain.  
I've diced and chopped and strained.  
I cry through the pain.

We become what we eat,  
as you've noodled out.
I'll rice your cauliflower.  
I'll mill your artichoke.

Some cats underflatuate.
I punctuate underneath.
We wonder what colors to express.
We giggle at dreams of our success.

We are all in some way or another going to Reseda
to make love to a model from Ohio whose real name you don't know.
Her name is Alexandra. And she is not as beautiful as she seems.
It is 5 a.m.
And you are listening
to shut the fuck up and listen.
