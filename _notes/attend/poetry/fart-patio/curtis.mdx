Inhale

When we pass from this plane
it strikes many of us
to tie up loose threads.
Others leave with stringed fingers.

You gave Allison
a leg to stand on.
She wouldn't jump
if the train was ablaze.

You left a house to rot,
pulled together by
what you love and
for who you love.

Soggy cardboard,
stankin' assets,
sons under the guns
royal flush.

Tunnels grow dark
without laser beams.
You've met Carl...
Naw'mean!
This kid is lit af!

Missing piece
Rolling stone
Allie's rock
Fill your bones

Pass in peace.
Be with us please.
This voids your lease
on what we need
to feel.

Love, endless love
what we came from
a minute
a moment
an instant
or for ever
like this
love
endless
unconditional
love.

Exhale
