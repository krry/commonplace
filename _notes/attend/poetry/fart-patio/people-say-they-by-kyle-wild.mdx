# People Say They By Kyle WildPeople say they
love you but
how do you
know if they
meant
it?

Come to your
senses

You push
just to
see if
they’ll take your
worst,
create silence
to see
who will
break it first.
there are
lots of ways
to know that you’re loved
but your
brain
is
the worst.

Come to your
sen-
ses
You know what
this
is.

You do things
that require
forgive-
ness
it gives you a chance
to test their
defen-
ses
hurt them a 
little just to
see how they
mend it

Come to your senses
there are lots of ways
to know that you’re loved.

Come to your senses.
Know that you’re loved.
