# Reading Eisenstein

## Aphorisms

"From QAnon's Dark Mirror, Hope":

> The standard Hollywood movie script is also the script for war and also, it seems, the script for a lot of today's political discourse.
>
> But really, who among us today has not suffered a breakdown in meaning or an unmet need to belong?

> Knowing that narrative warriors select, distort, or invent facts, the canny citizen tends to ask "Who said it?" before asking "What did they say?" and then to disbelieve what they said if it serves a disagreeable party or purpose. In such circumstances, how is any conversation possible?
>
> When the meaning offered us excludes obvious facts, direct experience, and our hearts' recognition of truth, no wonder so many of us lapse into nihilism, thinking that life and the universe itself is meaningless. That nihilism and the latent despair that drives it was QAnon's spawning ground. The same ground spawns mindless consumerism, technology fetishism, the hypnotic myth of progress, and the spectacular pseudo-dramas of politics, sports, and entertainment.
>
> Compassion is the tide of our times. Perhaps that is why increasingly furious attempts to sow hatred are required to maintain the psychic conditions for a control-based society. It takes more and more propaganda to keep us divided.
