# Notes on My Big TOE

- p.xx: “Genuine breakthrough must be absorbed slowly as existing paradigms grudgingly dissolve.”
- p.120: “Attaining wisdom, choosing paths to spiritual growth, improving the quality of consciousness, discerning pseudo-knowledge from actual knowledge and discriminating good teachers from bad teachers...”
- p.147: “A body may be enslaved by others, while a mind can only be enslaved by itself.”

Most of my notes are [over here](/docs/Reading "My Big Toe, Awakening, Discovery, Inner Workings: A Trilogy Unifying Philosophy, Physics, and Metaphysics".gdoc) in a Google Doc.
