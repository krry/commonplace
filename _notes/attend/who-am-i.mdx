# who am I

I am a collection of stories I tell myself about choices I make, have made, and will make. I am a focal point of existence-consciousness-bliss. I am awareness of here and now. I am being, knowing, enjoying.

I am not a man. I am not a human. I am being a human right now. I am here now. I am not my past successes and failures, nor my ambitions and dread for the future. But I am the stories I tell myself about successes and failures before now, about ambition and dread to come, about what I love and what I fear, about what I have done and what I will do, about who I was and who I become. I am writing every word, step, and line.

I am the author of my experiences, and the owner of a singular point of subjective perspective. I am a lens through which consciousness takes itself in. I am not an object. Nothing and no one is objective, except the absolute, unbounded, formless, shapeless unified Field of consciousness in constant motion.

I am breath in action, karma from prana. I am learning to relate to everything else in existence. I am an intricate amalgam of erection and invagination in the one cosmic membrane that folds to form every feature and to meet itself in every fashion imagined. I am 折り目なしの折り紙, origami without creases.

I am being knowing enjoying. I am a point of awareness through which consciousness enjoys its other manifestations. I attend and intend to quell ignorance and spread love.
