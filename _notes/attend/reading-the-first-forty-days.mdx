# The First Forty Days

- A book by and about new and ancient traditions for enriching the postpartum period with health and wellness

- Some excerpts:
  > I quickly discovered that Auntie Ou's "confinement care" came with a set of commandments: For one week after birth, I was to eat especially slowly, because my digestion was weak, and prioritize soft, traditional foods like black sesame with rice powder and ginger or congee with black sugar. Absolutely no cold food or drinks were to pass my lips, because these would slow down the circulation of blood necessary for optimal healing. After one week, I could graduate to eating the special postpartum soups they were creating from long-simmered bone broth and fish stock—these would help amplify and enrich my breast milk and balance my hormones so that my mood stayed elevated. Meanwhile, I was to stay in bed—or close to it—at all times, keeping my activity levels ultralow, and clothe myself in thick woolen socks, a cozy hat, and extra blankets so that my body stayed very warm. My computer, cell phone, and even my beloved tower of night-table books were hidden away, so that I wasn't tempted to distract myself when I should be sleeping.
