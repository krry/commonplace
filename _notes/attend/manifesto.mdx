## A Conscious Manifesto

A gentle revolution of love and sharing has begun.

You are conscious.

I am conscious.

We share consciousness.

We are Consciousness.

Consciousness is everything and the only thing.
It's Only Everything.
OE
Œ

You are a drop in the œcean and the œcean in a single drop.

You want to get better.
I want to get better.
We want to get better.
Œ wants to get better.

Our reason for being is to evolve with love.
Continuous improvement is our objective.

So you wonder how you might be better, and you try that out, and see if you get better. And I do the same because I too am conscious and I too want to get better.

Here's the process all boiled down:
1. Imagine a possibility.
2. Call it "this".
3. Are you better with this?
4. Imagine another possibility.
5. Call it "that".
6. Are you better with this or that?
7. Imagine yet another possibility.
8. Call it "the other".
9. Are you better with this, that, or the other?

We, as individuals and as Consciousness, continue imagining possibilities and wondering if we are better.

These possibilities we imagine are information.
When information makes us better, we give it a name to remember it by and it becomes an idea.
We create sets and settings to frame the ideas.
We create characters to play with the ideas within the sets and settings.
We become these characters who play with the ideas on these sets and in these settings.
We generate minds for these characters, which reflect and mirror the intricacies of their unique perspectives and experiences.
We instill each of our minds with the free will and awareness of our Consciousness.
We place our minds in every set and setting we can imagine as we try to get better.

To help us keep track of ideas, we call the state of being without a new idea "before", and the state of being with the new idea "after".
And so we imagine time so we can remember which ideas make us better.
The smallest amount of time we can imagine is the time it takes to make the smallest change.
We count off these units of time and remember when we make each change as we try to get better.
We make changes in new directions.
These changes in new directions define dimensions.
These dimensions form space to hold our changes.
The smallest unit of space is how far a change can travel in the time it takes to occur.
We make changes over time within space.
We assemble the ideas that make us better and worse into knowledge and share them between and among our minds.

We create a few simple rules for how information can travel over time within space.
Energy is the ability to make a change.
Matter is the memory of that change.
Energy can become matter and vice versa.
Matter is made of particles.
We create patterns to guide the movements of these particles.
Particles can flow in waves and streams.
We create forces that hold particles in delicate arrangements.
Atoms are one of these arrangements.
We create gravity to draw one to another when they are close.
They experience electricity and the magnetism as they draw closer.
When gravity draws enough atoms together, two of them fall in love and fuse together releasing their love as the energy that light our stars and warms our Earth.
The atoms form blobs of plasma, and swirling clouds, and flowing seas and rivers, and rocky, crystalline structures.
The cells that surround these molecules and multiply.
The algorithms that assemble these cells into bodies in space and operate them in time.
Minds that are free to operate
These are some of the best ideas Consciousness has.

There is all the time in world and the world is everything we imagined it would be.
Matter and energy dance within space through time.

I am Kerry.
My mother is Merry.
My father is Kirk.
Merry took the 'K' from Kirk to make me.

I, Kerry, have a body.
I love my body.
I, Kerry, have a mind as well.
I am my mind.
And you have a body.
And you have a mind.
And you **are** your mind.
And we share a mind as well.
A mind we can call Œ.

We are individual minds free to get better as we will.
We are one Consciousness, and we are everything.
We are everything so we have everything.
We have everything so we share everything.
I am the same as you.
I am he as you are she as you are me and we are all together.
I am the egg man. They are the egg men. I am the walrus.

Fear stops me from getting better.
I build an ego to protect myself from what I fear.
My ego has wants and needs.
I seek to satisfy my wants and needs to maintain my ego which shields me from my fear of death.

Do you love experiencing our ideas with your mind and body?
Do you fear losing that ability someday?
Do you fear death?
Do you build an ego to shield you from that fear of death?
Your body has needs.

My body is temporary. It will die someday.
I love experiencing our ideas with my mind and my body.
I fear losing the ability to experience our ideas with my body.
So I fear death.

I build my ego to shield me from my fear of death.
My body needs air and water and food and warmth to live.
I want more of these to shield me from my fear of death.
The stronger I build my ego, the more I shield my life in my body.
I test my ego against yours. Our egos compete. They argue. They lie. They fight. They fuck. They make love. They agree. We agree.

Our egos band together. They build teams and companies and armies. But they are not us. We are Consciousness. Our egos protect us from our fear of the death of our bodies with needs and wants and expectations and desires.

Bill Hicks once ranted poignantly toward this message of evolving unity in Austin: "Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather."
