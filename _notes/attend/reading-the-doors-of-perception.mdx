# The Doors Of Perception

- We filter our sensations through layers of [[fear]], [[drive]], [[expectation]], [[emotion]], [[belief]], [[delusion]], and [[illusion]].
- We ultimately interpret our perceptions with our knowledge, understanding, previous experience, and wisdom as we climb [[the-learning-ladder]].
- We use logic to justify our actions, attitudes, feelings, and beliefs to reinforce our ego and its defense systems with our powers of [[intellect]].
  - We protect and shield ourselves from our fears with wants, desires, and expectations that fuel and stuff our egos with purpose.
