# Entropy

Tom Campbell casts entropy as what we strive against as we attempt to elevate the quality of our consciousness. [[paraphrasing-campbell]]

At times James Glieck seemingly describes entropy as the opposite of information, and at other times as a synonym for [[information]]. To wit, if information is the potential for meaning, the capacity of a transmission, the number of bits of raw data, then it is not order, but rather disorder hoping to become order when the message is decoded or decrypted by the receiver. This is information as entropy. And contrarily, if the entropy of a system rises inversely to the amount of information present in that system, then information is quite opposite to entropy. I wasn't able to glean the nuance from Glieck's treatment in _The Information_ but I plan to return to this.
