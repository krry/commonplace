# Atmanaut Home Poems

## Utopiapocalypse

"Thank you endlessly!"\
Famous last words.\
We are the only oneness left\
being, knowing, enjoying.

### The Zeroth Principle

Yes! I think it's a dot
but when I lean closer
it might be a hooo...
............le. Oof!

### Awakenigh

Molting an aeon's dream as
lids split to rays of ice
cream on mirrors
raising eyes
at the stars they are.

### Immanent eschaton imminent

Consciousness accelerates complexity
toward incomprehensible density.
We Atmanauts need an atlas
for exploring Ourself as we
spelunk the essential.

### We'll ask the old questions.

The ones they gave up on.
The only ones that matter.
Shed ego, own ignorance,
hold space, give pause…

### Gratitude for your presence

We wander wondering "Why?"
collapsing possibilities,
embracing ignorance,
forgetting our selves,
being, knowing, loving,
holding space,
giving pause…
We are atmanauts.\\

### This is our atlas.

Ocean drop spot light search
Truth speaker seeking missiles
Wonder as we wander
We "Why?" open wide.
At last an atlas for atmanauts.

#### We all play the game.

Who's got the strategy guide?

#### Hey Google, whycome everything?

- Is it all maths? fields? possibilities? information? Mind?
- What tastes worse with bacon?
- Do whales sing birdsongs?
- Can I train my AI to speak with my dogs and cats?
- Will I find true love?
- Who doesn't have cancer?
- Is there a cure for dying?
- Why can't I lift myself off the ground?
- Is this normal? Am I okay?
- Whose line is it, anyway?

#### Welcome, traveler

To the which than which there is no whicher.

#### We can has emoji?

I sure would like emoji.
