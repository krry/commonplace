# Explanation vs Description

Here in the Postmodern West we tend to confusion description with explanation. A description answers "How?" while an explanation answers "Why?" Science is primarily a field of description. Yet we crave explanation, hence our tendency toward confusion.

Neuroscience provides ever-deepening and broadening descriptions of what is happening in our heads. It is easy to mistake these descriptions for explanation. We long for explanation, and distract ourselves with description. This path leads to lackadaisical oblivion. Taking description as explanation liberates from responsibility for our well-being. Such a condemnation begs illustration.

Expectations are the seeds of disappointment.
