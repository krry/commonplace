# Sacred Caring Doughnut Economics

## Welcome to the Crossroads, Human

As Paul Selig has received from his guides, we as humanity now stand at a crossroads. Each of us may choose to continue to attach to a human being, or to release that attachment and ascend to the perspective of the divine oneness who sits in the Well of Being at our center.

Seeing this moment from the vantage of the cosmic crown, we know what to do (nothing), how to feel (content), and what to think ("I am"). From that vantage we know who we are. To seeing this moment from below the crown, we can still peer inward, into the Well of Being that sits at center, know who we are, and let that solitary truth carry us to the crown.

To remain as humans being will be less pleasant, will engender discontentment as it always has, and will leave us mired in illusion. Today we would like to offer an array of pathways from the human to the divine, a drawer full of lenses to affix to our third eye as we reconsider our identity and our purpose.

The collective transcendence from ego to spirit which we are witnessing and experiencing offers a myriad of signifiers. We are showered in this psychic sneeze as we convulse to deliver it. First we will glide over the drawer and then pick up each lens.

In this piece we will examine our coronation as a shift:

## Perspectives

from [a critique of Doughnut Economics as too Western](https://views-voices.oxfam.org.uk/2012/02/is-doughnut-economics-too-western/ 'Is doughnut economics too Western? Critique from Latin American environmentalist, Eduardo Gudynas')

> But in my view, a discussion about sustainability requires the idea of development to be questioned, especially the Western conception of development. There are undoubtedly many ways of understanding development, and we have seen capitalist programmes with varying emphasis (neoliberal, Keynesian, neo-Keynesian, etc.), as well as socialist programmes (e.g. the Soviet model and all its variants), and even complex hybrids (like that of China). These tendencies have significant differences in terms of the role of state, the concept of property, and ways of redistributing wealth. The ‘right to development’ was also spoken about, which would greatly complicate the doughnut. But what is striking is that **they all share a set of basic ideas, all of them Western, such as the belief in progress, the appropriation of nature, and the dream of material comfort**. ‘Development’ involves common principles for organising society, production, and the relationship with the environment.

> The social and environmental crisis is so serious that it is now time to put aside minor adjustments and reforms, and instead address the root causes of resistance to the idea of development. We must adopt an approach whereby the term ‘sustainable development’ no longer requires the suffix ‘development’.

## Premises

When designing a model, we must first define its foundational assumptions. When evaluating a model, we must first expose and examine its premises.

## Questions

Can development coincide with sustainability and/or vice versa?

Can we pursue sustainable refinement without focusing on progress or development?

## the outdated neoliberal script

- free market is efficient
- incompetent state
- trade is win-win
- commons are tragic
- household is domestic
- finance is infallible
