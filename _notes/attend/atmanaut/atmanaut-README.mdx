# Atmanaut.me README

Spelunk the essential.

### This is:

A hugo-powered static site using the chakra theme, ready to link up with a
Forestry.io CMS, and auto-deployable on now.sh.

## TODO

- \[ \] load fonts with app, not from Google Fonts
  - \[x\] audit fonts and weights: serif light normal sans light italic
    normal cursive normal
- \[ \] [retina](https://github.com/simonsmith/postcss-at2x) and responsive images with @media queries
<!--more-->
- \[x\] scour hugo docs and try out features
  - \[x\] rss feed
- \[x\] add template for categories pages
- \[x\] use custom 404 page
- \[x\] refresh color palette: chakras, soulstones
- \[x\] refactor sass to css with postcss
- \[x\] make layout mobile friendly
- \[x\] debug auto-deploy with Forestry and now+github
- \[x\] structure metadata for tags in archetypes
- \[x\] flesh out tagging system for asidebar and posts
- \[x\] learn how to direct link to other posts; document below
- \[x\] style summaries: timestamps, titles, etc.
- \[x\] add routes to `now.json` to enable Github master push deploy
  - move `now.json` back to root
  - change npm scripts to work with new build config
- \[x\] add logo and brand

### To Consider

- \[ \] es6 support, babel, webpack, etc.
- \[ \] annotation lane for links and sidenotes (a la footnotes)
- \[ \] make page styles respond to background image colors with [postcss-get-color](https://github.com/ismamz/postcss-get-color)
- \[ \] load page faster by separating image CSS with [postcss-bgimage](https://github.com/ahtohbi4/postcss-bgimage)
- \[ \] add smooth gradients with [easing-gradients](https://github.com/larsenwork/postcss-easing-gradients)
- \[ \] test colors? [colorguard](https://github.com/SlexAxton/css-colorguard)

## Workflow

This static site employs the chakra-hugo-theme as a submodule. So generally the layouts, styles, and functionality come from the theme and are to be maintained therein. Content rests in this repo, and is updatable via the [Forestry.io]() CMS. The CMS auto-deploys the site when new content is saved. By deploying with `now+github` we are able to automate a lot of steps in the composing/publishing process.`now` uses my custom build script to rebuild the site with any updates, then aliases the deployment (when successful) to [Atmanaut.us]() and [Atmanaut.me]().

### Tags

Rather than try to sort this Atmanaut mess top-down, I've designed a bottom-up approach. Tags are required front matter for posts. All posts lie flat in the same directory. As tags become well-worn, we can transition them into categories, and give them a subdir, or even a `Section`.

To catalog sources for a given tag, make a file at `/tags/tag_name/_index.md` with the titles and links to the sources in the front matter. There is an archetype called `tags.md` that will give you the syntax.

### Images

To serve a wide array of screens, especially the retina screens that have 2x resolution, it's a good idea to save small, medium, and large versions, and 72dpi (@1x) and 144dpi (@2x) versions of images. We can use `mogrify` or `convert` from Imagemagick on the command line for this.

These 1x and 2x images can be optimized for size and quality with ImageOptim and ImageAlpha from the command line:

```bash
cd dir_with_images
imageoptim --imagealpha '**/*.png' '**/*.jpg'
```

## Tagging, Categories, and Taxonomies

Hugo provides two [default taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/#default-taxonomies): tags and categories. Additional taxonomies can be added in the `config.yaml` like so:

```yaml
taxonomies:
  example: examples
  thing: things
```

Then you can use it in `YAML` front matter like so:

```markdown
---
title: An article por ejemplo
things: bunnicula, flying saucers
tags: punishment, acrobatics
---
```

Each taxonomies type gets its own page (e.g. `/categories`, `/tags`) and each term in the taxonomy gets a page listing all its members (e.g., `/tags/horsenames`).

## Linking

Hugo provides `relURL` and `absURL` for your linking needs. These power `.RelPermalink` and `.Permalink` respectively.

Use .RelPermalink when you might alter the locations of the `publicDir` or `contentDir`, or restructure the dynamically generated `[permalinks]` in the site `config.toml`.

Use .Permalink when the file won't move, or for external purposes, such as sharing and for post title links.

External links are given `target=_blank` thanks to the `BlackFriday` markdown compiler. In the `config.yaml`, mark `hrefTargetBlank` and `plainIDAnchors` true.

For internal links, use the standard markdown link syntax or a reference link.

```markdown
[This is a standard link](/code/README/)

[And this is a reference link][reflink]

[reflink]: /code/README/
```
