# Create a Preact-on-Parcel SPA in a Jiffy

_Earthdate 2019.04.15.21.41.32.745._

**Tax Day.**

This year I'm going ultra-minimal. Traveling with /r/onebag. No furniture, just yoga mats. All I need is one spork.

So when I want to prototype a lightweight interactive web experience, I struggle with the cruft and bloat of React on Webpack, as versatile and powerful as it might be. Wouldn't you just love a webpack build without the `webpack.config.js`? Could a zero config build system be performant? Can you imagine a React wapp without the React bloat? Components without the convoluted verbosity?

If you want the paper airplane of dev frameworks, look no further. If you want to sneeze and have a fully-featured web app to dev on, and then sneeze again to add build features or components, here's your jelly and/or .

[Preact](https://preactjs.com) does much of what React can do with only 3kb of ugly gzip. [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) is a zero-config bundler/builder that smells like `webpack` but tastes (and works) like **Wonka**. After we get the engine running, we'll think about a turbo.

#### 1. First, we draw a blank... dir.

```sh
mkdir -p preact-parcel-app/src    # -p flag makes parents
cd preact-parcel-app
```

#### 2. I like to let `yarn` initialize the dir.

```sh
yarn init -y                      # -y flag says 'yes'
```

#### 3. Then have `yarn` install our slim dependencies.

```sh
yarn add -D parcel-bundler        # -D flag to --save-dev
yarn add preact preact-compat     # compat with react methods
```

#### 4. Now we add a `dev` command to the `package.json`.

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"dev": "parcel src/index.html --open"
	}
}
```

At this point, if you're following along, you may realize you could just be cloning [a Preact Parcel starter kit repo](https://github.com/krry/preact-on-parcel) and renaming it to be your own. If instead you're the defiant DIY type, type on.

#### 5. Next we make an entry point for `parcel` in `src/index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<title>Preact-on-Parcel</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="app"></div>
		<script src="./index.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### 6. Now we need to mount the Preact app.

```js
// src/index.js
import { h, render } from 'preact'
import App from './App'

const mountNode = document.getElementById('app')
render(<App />, mountNode, mountNode.lastChild)
```

#### 7. Then we'll need an App Component.

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import { h, Component } from 'preact'
import './App.css'

export default class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<h1>Preact-on-Parcel</h1>
				<p>Triumphant!</p>
			</div>
		)
	}
}
```

#### 8. Lastly a few styles to make it clear that it worked.

```css
/* src/App.css */
body {
	margin: 0;
	display: flex;
	flex-flow: column nowrap;
	justify-content: space-evenly;
	align-items: center;
	font-family: 'Fantasque Sans Mono', system-ui, sans-serif;
	background-color: hsl(260, 48%, 22%);
	color: hsl(260, 56%, 84%);
}
```

#### 9. P-o-P it off!

    yarn dev

### What dreams may come!

Parcel can handle all manner of assets. It sits in wait, ready to automagically install dependencies when you start using them. There are a bunch of bundles and build features that Parcel can sniff out from a runcom or config file like: `.postcssrc, postcss.config.js, .browserslistrc, .babelrc`

The cool part about these little runcoms is how portable they are. Just copy and drop them into a new project. For instance, [let's say you want to autoprefix your css](https://parceljs.org/css.html). Just add autoprefixer settings to a runcom for PostCSS: `.postcssrc` or `postcss.config.js` will work.

```json
{
	"modules": true,
	"plugins": {
		"autoprefixer": {
			"grid": true
		}
	}
}
```

Save that file. You may have to stop and restart parcel, you may not. The other way to add features to the Parcel build is via `yarn`/`npm`. So [if you want to write your styles in Sass](https://parceljs.org/scss.html), there's a one-liner for that:

```sh
yarn add -D sass
```

Well, that's it. Check the docs for [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/guide/getting-started) for more. Thanks for playing. Hope your refund was hefty _af_.

### If you thought that was funâ€¦

I don't know what to tell you. Try downhill underwater lexicography? Or antarctic vegetable taxidermy? It doesn't get much more exciting.

I enjoyed reading [the AMA that Preact's author Jason Miller did](https://jasonformat.com/preact-ama-on-sideway/).

If you have any Parcel tips, please leave them here in the Comments. So much to flesh and figure out, lots of potential!
