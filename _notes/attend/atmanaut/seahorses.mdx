# Seahorsing

> Dear Fili,
> Yesterday was work. That probably came out of left field. But imagine our surprise when we found out you aren't ours.

So starts the letter that has turned my world upside down. In March I turned 37. My daughter is this many ✌️☝️. My husband is not his father's son **or** his mother's son. And now I know that neither am I such a daughter.

<!--more-->

My identity has never been certain. We contain multitudes I am told, and I am such a "We". We remember the fog of childhood. We learned of courage by stepping into the opaque. When the air looks like chalk you can taste it, the staunch.

One Christmas, might have been the year Gramma Root died, we went to the mall. Not on Christmas (we're not heathen), but weeks before, like good dollar-fearing consumers. At the mall there was a pop-up shop. Mind you, this was the advent of the 90s. Caution-signs litter the terrazo as boots melt into puddles. The circumferent walk-joggers shop overhead physically raising awareness of their conspicuous consumption. A piano jingles a prayer about resting merry gentleman, though the jingler is too frightened to sing in this operatic setting. Instead we humble the words under our breath as we slideshoe from candle store to calendar store.

### At the calendar store, I saw kitties!

Not actual kitties of course. It wasn't Petland. Pictures of kitties. And what I craved more than anything in the world as a _what do you call a six-year-old_ fumbler was delicate, warm, wriggling comfort. Petting. What I craved was a natural outcropping of my being deprived of its evolved expectations for consistent, profound contact with flesh, the flesh of kin and prey and earth.

The kitties were too high up, so I pointed at them, and called for help. "Hello my name is… Austin" materialized with a helpful smirk. "Can I help you, sir?"

#### Time stops.

My brother stands behind me. Ozzie can hear Austin. Austin has plant matter on, in, and around his braces. A living breathing food court salad bar monster. The merry gentlemen are resting on a B-flat. The _at-mall-sphere_ quivers with notes of conifer and clove, while mistletoe dangles the threat of intimacy in every doorway. My last kiss was from Gramma, and my summer bowl-cut has not grown out yet, though it did get the gum out of my hair.

"Sir?" My inner monologue wonders, circumspects, cringes.

As fumblers, we don't know much, and we try to believe what we hear. Austin was looking at me, not Ozzie behind me. I still remember the wombjerk reaction: "I'm not **_Sir_! I'm Princess Filona."**

Ozzie was stoic as always. I clenched my fists inside the pockets of my purple and fuchsia parka.

> Fuck kitties, I'm a girl. Or… crap. I hate this song. Men aren't gentle or merry. Mom is merry. Where is Mom?

### Whence the Letter

Mom doesn't write much. Mom looked to Dad for that. Dad looks to her for content. As a fumbler, I looked to them both for everything. Yesterday I was looking for belonging.

#### Yesterday the order came down that humans are to be kept outside of spitting space. I was spitting mad.

So I lashed out in digital sarcasm, instagrammed a fresh loogey stain on the sidewalk. "Nice masks, SF."

It turns out all sarcasm is digital, as it lies in direct denial of the organic. Tracing this new mantra on the interior cotton of my mask with my tongue, I could taste the irony.

> Sarcasm opposes reality.

One of those things Dad used to say a lot. One of the more lasting whorls in the abyssal grain of my mind. I thumbed up a phone-a-fram. Dad picked up.

### "'ello, this is Hip."

We don't often look at the portal as we pass through it. But this time the tunnel walls were carpeted with nostalgia as I was slurped back to the source. Hipposkin rugs, swatches of vicarious safaris, a cavernous monument of mental effigy woven of disappointments cemented with the plentiful spooge of MICPOP[‡](#micpop) ambition.

I ended up where I started. Dad was anything but hip.

Dad posed as though, played those roles, but once all the spaghetti had hit the wall no one could suppose that our trusty Hippo was trendy. Yes, he was like a river: ever present, ever flowing, and never the same. As the fourth wall crumbles you may find yourself a pebble or a boulder. The boulder invites the hedgehog to perch. The fox follows the pebble.

\[‡\]: Military-Industrial-Corporate-Penitentiary-Oligopolistic-Personage. Nonviolent defiance of MICPOP is like the PATRIOT act for pacifists.
