# Where Is My Mind

## TLDR

It's not in your head. It's a field around your body.

- Little evidence of that
- As much as we talk about being in our heads, we don't tend to experience much inside our heads aside for the occasional ache
- Eyes receive an image of what they look toward. The image would be upside down and backward to what is perceived, according to the western sense of optics.
- [[scopaethesia]]
  - the feeling of being looked at
  - a widely reported phenomenon
  - studied at length by [[rupert-sheldrake]]
    - noticeable even through telescopic lens and over CCTV
  - we can detect attention directed at us, even indirectly if the attention is intended for us, from other places and across spans of time
- Neuronal activity
  - Brainwave patterns tend to be invariant when mapping sensory experiences to the mind. Seeing, hearing, etc have recognizable brain activity patterns.
  - Variable neuronal activity patterns present and represent memory, thought, intuition, improvisation, interpretation.
