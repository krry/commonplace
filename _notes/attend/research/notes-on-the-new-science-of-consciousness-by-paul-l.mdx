# Notes on *The New Science of Consciousness* by Paul L. Nunez

p. 28:
**pre-conscious** and **subconscious** are equivalent, and subcategories of unconscious, referring to that which influences conscious behavior without the person's subjective awareness.

unconscious indicates a lack of awareness

p. 57:
Olfactory signals do not crossover the hemispheres for decoding, unlike the signals of the other four traditional senses: sight, sound, touch, and taste.

p. 65:
"Consciousness of a sensory stimulus is apparently represented in the total activity of distributed cortical networks rather than any one network node. Consciousness is closely tied to the brain's dynamic patterns."

p. 80:
"Memories with strong emotional components are much more likely to endure."

p. 83:
### Neurotransmitter deficiencies
Lack of dopamine occurs in the brains of schizophrenic and ADHD sufferers. Serotonin deficiency occurs in the brains of clinically depressed people. Glutamate deficiency has been linked to autism, OCD, schizophrenia, and clinical depression.

p. 96:
Research on human brains is severely limited and restricted by ethical concerns. The last time cortico-cortical fibers were dissected from a human brain and measured was in the 1940s. The brain belonged to a death-sentenced prisoner who donated his brain to science. Ethics clearly halt the progress of research if this is the case.

p. 98:
### Damasio's hierarchy of three layers of consciousness:
> The *protoself* represents a pre-conscious state shared by all life-forms including single-celled organisms. These entities detect internal and external physical changes that affect the organism's well-being. The protoself provides an essential foundation for the two higher stages of "self" to build on.
> *Core consciousness* occurs when organisms develop a sense of self as brains build representative images; this level is not exclusive to humans. Core consciousness is concerned only with the present moment, the here and now. It does not require language or memory; nor can it reflect on past experiences or project itself into the future.
> *Extended consciousness* occurs when awareness moves beyond the here and now and employs extensive use of memory. This so-called autobiographical layer of self is anchored in the more-basic protoself and core consciousness. It gradually becomes aware of past, present, and future. While the extended consciousness may be substantially enhanced by language, language is not necessarily required.
Language may be required for the next layer of consciousness that bridges minds in disparate bodies together. See *The Internet*.

p. 111:
Thomas Nagel, who proposed the gedanken about what it's like to be bat, argued that "consciousness cannot be explained without reference to the subjective character of experience. Furthermore, this subjective nature cannot be explained by reductionism."

p. 123:
Coma state: the Atman leaves the body; no normal wake-sleep cycle and does not produce voluntary actions; no wakefulness and is unable to feel, speak, hear, or move.

The outcome/well-being of anesthetized patients has been known to respond to positive or negative talk from their operating doctors.

p. 133:
"In the most severe case, global aphasia, speech is mostly absent. Yet many of these patients are able to use swear words easily with the proper pronunciation."

p. 153:
When giving directions to a friend to his house which you could reach taking either of two alternate paths, Yogi Berra once said: "When you come to a fork in the road, take it."

Gather other gems from Berra to pepper into your writing.

p. 155:
#### on Libet's experiments
The conscious will seems to have 100 ms to veto an unconscious impulse.
Sensations must last 500 ms to register in the conscious mind.
Unconscious reactions can occur in 150 ms.

Intentions: We consciously recruit unconscious agents to perform certain actions impulsively and within certain constraints.

p. 160:
"[F]unctional connections can be turned on and off rather quickly, on timescales consistent with experience and behavior" (compared to structural connections consisting mainly of axons that connect one brain location to another: cortico-cortical (within the grey matter of the cortex) (95-98%), thalamo-cortical (into the sub-cortical white matter) (2-5%).)

p. 279:
"A possible counterargument to the random interpretation of abiogenesis is that some unknown organizing principle, perhaps related in some manner to entropy or information, facilitated the generation of life from molecular systems."

The presence of a conscious choice or agent would eschew randomness.

p. 280:
Life is much more complex that turbulent systems which are much too complex to simulate with computer models. How could artificial consciousness, which would be much more complex than non-conscious life to simulate/model, be plausible in practice or principle?

p. 282:
"life processes create a decrease in internal entropy, the so-called inaccessible information"

p. 287:
"[L]anguage acts to increase consciousness level, both through interacting with other persons as well as facilitating communication between the semi-isolated subsystems of individual brains."

Language expands consciousness.

p. 295:
The hidden sector has been called wavefunction collapse, many worlds, multiverse, implicate order, and coherent histories.

The basic laws that govern our universe provide all information barriers: "relativity limits speed; quantum mechanics limits quantity; and thermodynamics limits quality of information transfer."

p. 303:
#### Types of long-term memory
- episodic memory of specific past events
- semantic memory (knowledge about the external world)
- procedural memory (use of objects or body movements) - cerebellum
- emotional memory - limbic system

p. 309:
"*Entropy* refers to ordinary information that is normally inaccessible to measurement but may become accessible with appropriate observations." Such as the immense amount of total information contained in a baseball at the quantum scale, versus the relatively small amount of accessible information about its dynamics as it flies.

p. 310:
Ultra-information encompasses unknowable information (like what has happened subsequently on a star we can see that is light years away, i.e., whose light we see is old), and ordinary information which can accessible or inaccessible (like the entropy of a system). "Ultra-information is that which distinguishes one thing from another." May include Einstein's "spooky action at a distance", Bohm's implicate order, Heisenberg's wavefunction collapse, parallel universes, and consciousness.

#### Table 10-1. Established (I-III) versus Speculative (IV) Physics
| I Classical Physics | II Quantum Mechanics | III Relativity | IV Speculative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Newton's laws | Wavefunction yields statistical information | Einstein 4D space-time | Wavefunction collapse |
| Chaos | Uncertainty principle limits quantity of information | Mass is stored energy | Bohm mechanics |
| Complex systems | Quantum tunneling in modern technology | Space limits speed of information | Many worlds |
| Circular causality | Light is wave or particle depending on experiment | Time dilation | Infinite multiverse |
| Electromagnetic waves in empty space | Entanglement | Black holes | Worm holes |
| Energy conservation | Nonlocal influences over large distances (spooky) | Dark energy | Information is fundamental |
| Entropy increases in closed systems |  | Dark matter | Quantum influences on consciousness |

p. 321:
#### Fields that lack an underlying structure:
- electromagnetic field
- quantum wavefunction
- dark energy - affects space-time
- dark matter - affects ordinary mass
- light
- magnetic field
- electric field
- ultra-information - affects brains

Perhaps the Unified Field Theory can throw us a bone.

p. 324:
"the brain may act as a kind of antenna that interacts selectively with some external entity."

## Glossary
- abiogenesis: The natural process of life emerging from nonliving matter like organic chemicals.
- alpha rhythm: EEG signals with relatively large frequency components in the 8 to 13 Hz range; waking, relaxed brains
- explanatory gap: The difficulty that materialistic theories have in explaining how physical properties can give rise to the mind.
- engram: The physical representation of memory in the brain
- binding problem: The issue of how widely distributed neural activities give rise to a single integrated behavior and consciousness.
- Bohm mechanics: A nontraditional ("non-Copenhagen") interpretation of quantum mechanics that explicitly exposes its inherent nonlocal character, allowing for an unmeasured particle's properties to depend on multiple influences that act over arbitrarily large distances from the measurement site, acting at greater-than-light speed or infinite speed.
- delta rhythm: EEG oscillations with frequencies in the approximate range of 1-4 Hz; observed in sleeping brains
- multiscale conjecture: The view that consciousness is encoded at multiple scales and depends fundamentally on cross-scale interactions (circular causality).
- RQTC conjecture - Relativity, quantum mechanics/theory, and thermodynamics—the laws of information that govern the physical universe—can shed light on the hard problem of consciousness.
- gamma rhythm: Brain rhythms with frequencies greater than about 30 Hz; mental tasks rhythms observed with intracranial probes
- theta rhythm: EEG oscillations with frequencies in the approximate range of 4–8 Hz; waking rhythms

- Planck scale: time, energy, space
- binding by synchrony: A process by which different features of an animal's world are represented by distinct brain networks that become functionally connected by synchronous rhythms. A subcategory of binding by resonance, which is cross-frequency coupling caused by resonant interactions between distinct (semi-autonomous) subsystems, including brain networks.
