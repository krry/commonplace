# Self-Sovereign Manifesto

The [[tenets]] of Sovereignty

## v0

### Generous

I direct my full attention, give all my time and energy, and devote my song and dance to our Full Being Smile.

### Willing

My attention, energy, choices, and actions all follow my intentions.
The intentions I set generate the world I experience.
I ask whether the intentions I set come from love or fear.

### Able

I easily receive what I need to be able to give more.

### Responsible

I own only what I breathe. For everything else, I care.
I am 100% responsible for the full impact of all my choices.
