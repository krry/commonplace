# Unified Field Theory

"Consciousness is everything and yet no-thing: formless, shapeless, absolute and unbounded. As consciousness relates to itself (there is nothing else to relate to after all) it gives rise to the dynamic structure of reality, its first Form, which we can call Space: reality cells within reality cells, uniformly arranged as equally sized and closely packed spheres would be. Perfect oranges stacked at the cosmic grocery store, each uniformly filled with smaller oranges and contained by larger ones ad infinitum in fractal symmetry at every scale above and below, extending without apparent limit in three dimensions.

Consciousness moves at a constant rate. Distortion travels from a cell to adjacent cells, diluting as it goes. Diluted distortion can compound in a cell as it enters from multiple adjacent cells, but there is a maximum level beyond which the content of a cell cannot become more distorted. Think of this as pure black which can only exist in relation to pure white, complete uniformity, the opposite of distortion. Electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, and any manner of energetic but immaterial vibrations take this second Form, which is tempting to call Energy. The second Form passes from cell to cell at the constant rate of the motion of Consciousness, which we observe to be the speed of light. Second Forms have a linear component and a radial component. The radial components reinforce the distortion of the linear component (keeping it at its maximum) along its vector of passage and radiate and dissipate in every other direction as the distortion travels. When multiple second Forms of distortion travel together, their distortion can harmoniously coalesce, effectively entwining them into compound distortion Forms that reinforce their collective distortion and contain the lightspeed propagation of each individual second Form into intricate in a slower moving, more complex Form that dances within with the fully energy of the motion of Consciousness. We can call this third Form Matter.
