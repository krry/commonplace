# Renaming Consciousness

The sense I am developing does not refer to the same sense others use when they speak of "consciousness". So I need a new term. Perhaps I can locate a couple of old terms and smoosh them together.

Consciousness
Continuousness
Con(sci/tinu)ousness
Conxousness
Cnxsness
Cnxns
C(n•n)s
Cn²s
C(x)ness
[[cnxns]]

[cnxns]: cnxns "CNXNS"
