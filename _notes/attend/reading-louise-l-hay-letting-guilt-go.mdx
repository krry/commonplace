# Letting Guilt Go

Friends, sinners, saints, sufferers, beings humanâ€”do you know _You Can Heal Your Life_? I'm shocked and awed and all the wisdom packed into this gem from 1984, a redux and expansion of Louise L. Hay's 1976 debut, Heal Your Body. We've had a handbook for curtailing our ailments through mindfulness since Big Brother started watching.

The ultra cliff notes neutron star espresso distillation of her message is this:
Health problems are negative thoughts manifested in our bodies. We can heal by taking full responsibility for our thoughts and feelings, then continually and compassionately orienting our hearts/minds toward betterment through love.

It doesn't get simpler. It couldn't be easier. Which is not to say that healing is simple or easy, just that this is the direct path, straight from the Source to that infinite love generator at the core of your/our being. And yet, that whole taking responsibility part can be a doozy, especially if, like me, you grew up in or currently reside in a culture of Guilt, and have not yet halted those destructive thought patterns.

For me, Guilt has been a lifelong crippling illness, one from which I'm recovering only now in my Third Half. The road to recovery has been long and winding. The dark night of the soul can go on for months, even years, and can recur. A headlong dive into the downward spiral found me missing bottom rather than hitting it. It turns out there is no bottom, only a new top and another spin on the wheel.

And yet even now I can barely bring myself to talk about it, for fear that my realizations will be revealed as wrong. This fear of being wrong is itself a symptom of Guilt. They stem from the same story that today has many of us in its clutches. That story is one of separate selves, scarcity of resources, hierarchies of value, and isolation from the Source of Being, and, at this point, it comes in any flavor, format, or language imaginable. You already know it by head, but hopefully less so by heart.

Here's a synopsis.

Each of us is a separate being with its own mind. The planet we live on has finite resources that we compete for. Consequently survival is a struggle and life is suffering. Only through mastery of matter can we hope to have enough, either through the alchemical transformation of trash into treasure, or by expanding our sphere of control and plunder from the bottom of the sea to the farthest galaxy. The best any of us can do is amass as much influence and attract as much attention as possible in order to keep everyone striving as hard as they can to get more, make more, do more, before they die.

Here we've have some varying theories.

Some of us can't stop never stopping, because at the end of timeline road lies the Apocalypse, a Day of Reckoning when our karma becomes pass/fail. No one has ever seen or met the Grand Arbiter, but we tell stories about such encounters. The prizes and punishments last forever. It's no wonder that Guilt and the fear of being wrong rides us into the ground, into tremulous inaction.

Others attend the Church of Material Scientism. They shrug in futility, confident the Sun will pointlessly swallow the Earth long after they pass, followed long after by the uncaring Void of Universal Heat Death. Coincidence is random. The Big Bang is a mystery.
