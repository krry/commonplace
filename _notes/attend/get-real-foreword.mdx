# Foreword

Dear Reader,

I present to you a highly subjective work of questionable science. I write this directly to you: in the active voice, in the present tense, and from the first person where reason and clarity allow. I do this because I love you and I want this to be as pleasant an experience as possible for both of us. I hope you will permit me to be frank, forgive me when I am blunt (or wrong or both), and lend me the patience you would lend yourself. I'll use contractions, sometimes. I won't waste your time.

I will however ruthlessly challenge the beliefs you hold dear. And I will ask the hardest questions I can come up with and then answer them without leaning on dogma or faith or doctrine or belief. I implore you to arrive at your own answers to your own questions.

As we proceed I will refer to topics that we will discuss in greater depth at another point in this journey. The free will in me honors the free will in you, so at first mention of a new topic I will hyperlink you to its section, and leave you a portal back. If your curiosity so compels you, let loose and dance around. This is your book now. I have read it like eleventeen times, and while it is one of my favorites, I am done with it.

Much of what you will encounter here has struck other minds; the Truth is as old as time itself, simpler than dirt, and it bears repeating any way you can say it. If I am aware of prior echoes, I will link to you them, or at the very least hang a tiny numeral on the thought and leave you a note at the end about how to find out more. If I am blissfully unaware of my mimicry, I hope these kindred minds abide our coincident realizations with delight. There is a bittersweet sort of compersive [mutida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudita) to be reaped in inventing, coining, or conceiving of something, only to find that another has already prototyped, popularized, or developed that very thing into a fully fledged manifestation. I had to admit my ignorance (continuously), obliterate my ego and its pride, and set down the brilliance of others for long enough to write this little ditty in the fervent hope that you, dear reader, will not have to search as far and long as I did to discover (and grok) the Truth.

Without further adoâ€¦
