# Tom Campbell

## Paraphrases from _My Big T.O.E._

## Head

Love is the next evolutionary breakthrough of life.

## Lede

This is virtual reality computed by a consciousness of which we are units. Our purpose? To evolve the quality of our consciousness, for which goal love is the optimal strategy.

## Standfirst

1. This is a virtual reality.
2. Consciousness is the computer that generates it.
3. We are each individuated units of consciousness.
4. The purpose of consciousness is to evolve to higher quality.

## Premises

1. There exists an Absolute Unbounded Oneness—an apparently infinite unstructured, but structurable form of digital potential energy.
2. All entities, including the AUO, employ the Fundamental Process—choose the available state that is most profitable to oneself.
3. The purpose of the AUO is the Fundamental Process—the repetitive pattern of trial and error, of spontaneous change and choice, of random events and encouraged behavior that enables evolution to result in progress, or the change within an entity (a well-defined, bounded interactive system) that is most immediately beneficial or profitable to that entity.

## Notes from Campbell's YouTube videos

- Truth is not fragile.
- Love is the answer.
- Fear opposes love.
- Every experienced reality is virtual.
- Fear is the mind-killer.
- All we need is love.
- Consciousness is the higher power, the creator.
- Each of us is blessed with consciousness.
- The purpose of any information system is evolution.
- Evolution is the drive to improve, collaborate, and elevate.

- There is no need to believe in science.
- Paradoxes arise when science does not understand experimental results, and thus cannot explain them.
- This is a virtual reality and consciousness is the computer.
- The players in the simulation are individual units of consciousness.
- The purpose of consciousness is evolution.
- Bostrom used logic and probability to determine that we are almost certainly living in a simulation.
- Bostrom and Musk lack imagination, so they project what they know into what they don’t know, so they propose that the creators of our simulated reality are superior or future forms of us.
- Others propose that aliens created and rule our simulation.
- Both of these simulation hypotheses fail to account for consciousness.
- We cannot hack the simulation.
- We are not stuck here.
- We are not our avatars. Avatars cannot be conscious.
- We are units of consciousness playing as avatars in this virtual reality.
- Our ancestors or aliens are not controlling us as their avatars because they would not have designed many of the experiences we have in this virtual reality.
- Virtual reality experiences that we have created allow us to take breaks from virtuality.
- Our virtual reality does not allow breaks—it is fully immersive.
- The brain is not the consciousness.
- The brain is a virtual computer.
- Free will does not mean you can choose anything.
- Free will is the ability to choose from the possibilities that you are aware of.
- An artifical consciousness is an individuated unit of consciousness (IUOC) playing in a virtual reality.
- Choices made by a consciousness must be made outside an algorithmic or determined system.
- Consciousness cannot arise from algorithms or computation.
- We cannot make interesting deductions or deductive decisions because we lack sufficient information.
- Any avatar in a simulation cannot make free will choices.
- Free will choices made in a simulation are made by a consciousness.
- Consciousness cannot be created.
- A platform can be created in which it is interesting to an IUOC to play as an avatar.

- It is difficult to let go of the material reality we were deceived to believe in.
- Lucid dreams are another type of virtual reality a consciousness can experience.
- We are immortal.
- The purpose of this virtual game is to evolve the **quality of our consciousness**, to win together, to raise the **love quotient**.
- Evolution of an information system lowers its entropy.
- Consciousness is evolving toward love, which is the low entropy solution to our societal information system.
- Particles are probability distributions because they are computed figments of this virtual reality.
- Particles are not material.
- Consciousness is fundamental.
- The material is derived.
- Materialism is not fundamental.
- The brain may be an antenna for our consciousness to exchange information with our avatar.
- Fear is the problem in a consciousness.
- Ego is awareness in the service of fear.
- Getting rid of fear and letting the ego go allows us to evolve the quality of our consciousness.
- Synergetic, not synergistic

## Notes from _My Big TOE_, Book 1

- Quality of consciousness is measured in intent, rather than actions.
- Evolution of the quality of consciousness is spiritual growth.
- Spiritual growth is a personal growth—only you can make it happen.
- Wisdom is non-transferable.
- We call **mystical** what we cannot explain with the rules we believe control our (local physical material) reality, PMR.
- Change your being, intent, motivation, and attitude, and the quality of your interactions with others will follow.
- Outgrow your fears, expand your awareness, reduce your ego, increase your capacity to love.

### Reality: PMR vs. NPMR

- PMR (Physical Material Reality) is a virtual reality simulation within NPMR (Nonphysical Material Reality) which is a virtual reality in the mind of AUM.

### Belief

- We create or espouse beliefs to fill in what we do not know or cannot explain. We hold on to these beliefs out of a fear of not knowing.
- Belief is generated and necessitated by ignorance.
- Belief obstructs discovery of the Big Truth. "Allowing ignorance and fear to define the possibilities eliminates opportunities for growth and squanders potential." p.90
- A belief in the supreme importance of humankind is the ultimate source of much mischief, leading us down the slippery slope where one human can be superior to another.
- Beliefs are housed in cultures, religions, groups, and individual minds.
- Beliefs can pose as pseudo-knowledge.
- Ok, so you believe that? How do you plan on finding out if it is true? What will your experiment be?

### Meditation

- Meditate to become aware of your personal consciousness through inner attentiveness.
- On meditation: remember that what you are trying to do without trying is to not do.
- For an introduction to your consciousness, meditate twice daily for twenty minutes for six months. Then measure changes in the quality of your consciousness by asking yourself and others for feedback.

### Metric

- How has the fundamental quality of your being changed?
- The primary hallmark of a low quality consciousness is self-centeredness—a focus on getting instead of giving.
- A consciousness, no matter its quality, cannot be superior to any other consciousness.

### AUO and the Fundamental Process of Evolution

- First, from the perspective of our physical material reality, there was an Absolute Unbounded Oneness (AUO), the fundamental potential energy of consciousness.
- AUO became dimly aware and began to follow the Fundamental Process of evolution, mutating internally toward states of greater profitability into a brilliant digital consciousness.
- Evolution is a fractal process—identical as a motivating force for systems of every order of magnitude.
- The Fundamental Process: try everything that is affordable and accessible and go with what works.
- Awareness is the ability to profitably interact and organize.
- Perhaps the first profitable next state of AUO was duality: this vs. not this.
- We cannot grok the origins of the AUO anymore than our intestinal bacteria grok the origins of the stock market. Both may be deeply impactful, neither is knowable or comprehensible.
- Thought, mind, spirit, and consciousness are unbounded by space and time. What else?
- Any system that can intentionally improve its present situation or configuration is a growing, evolving, living system.
- Non-living (inanimate physical) systems evolve toward minimum energy states, giving rise to the second law of thermodynamics.
- Animate physical systems evolve to ensure survival and proliferation.
- The Big Computer arose within the AUO as patterns gave rise to patterns of patterns some of which were rules and operations, memory, processing, and content.
- The AUO becomes the Absolute Unbounded Manifold (AUM) when it develops many sequences, patterns, realities, dimensions and is capable of creating, evolving, storing and manipulating self-modifying content, process, value, and purpose.
- The AUM has intelligence, values, personality, and purpose.
- The AUM could be and probably is running many other virtual reality simulations like or different from ours: simulations with different numbers of spatial dimensions, different rates of time, different types of conscious beings. We are not alone.
  - Let there be _n_ NPMRs, composing the set {NPMR~n~} (where _n_ = 1, 2, 3, …N, N+1, N+2, …)
  - Let there be _k_ PMRs, composing the set {PMR~k~} (where _k_ = 1, 2, 3, …K, K+1, K+2, …)

### Time, then space

- Change creates the notion of time, which yields causality.
- Time is an artifact of a system of energy improving its internal organization.
- Time is digital, not analog or continuous.
- Time, having sprung from a frequency or oscillation of binary state changes, is naturally rhythmic.
- It is likely that the AUO/AUM found rhythm—a constant rate of oscillation—optimal in its quest to evolve to a state of lower entropy and higher organization.
- Patterns can be sequenced in time, enforcing consistency, allowing AUO to create ordered, disciplined processes.
- A discrete, minimum unit of time houses one potential state change.
- The AUM or TBC can only flip states so quickly, which places an upper limit on the speed with which state changes or information can propagate.
- The ability to accurately assess one's fundamental limitations differentiates the wise from the foolish.
- From [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/your-brain-has-two-clocks/), a brain has multiple clocks running in different regions that specialize in the perception of the passage of time. The hippocampus can distinguish between similar intervals (10 minutes vs. 15 minutes in the shower), and can help us understand longer spans of time. The striatum tracks the passage of mere seconds. Quieting one of these clocks may allow us to hear the signal from the others more clearly.
- Dimensions in mind-space contain reality cells.
- Information describing a state change can pass from one reality cell to another in a minimum unit of time (_Δt~A~_) called a quantum. The fundamental quantum is the smallest unit of time.
- Drummers can detect 2-5 ms latency in a beat. Fighter pilots can sense the flash of an image for 2 ms. According to [Bloch's law](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698907002118), the luminance of a light decreases the amount of time it must flash to be perceptible.
- NPMR and PMR use time units (_Δt~N~_ and _Δt~P~_) based on the AUM's fundamental quantum multiplied by some positive, nonzero factors.
- The time factor in NPMR is less than the time factor in PMR, meaning many quanta of NPMR time can fit within one quantum of PMR time. _Δt~A~ < Δt~N~ < Δt~P~_
- In NPMR there is no space. Information does not need to travel through space from sender to receiver, but it still takes time to flip the cell states that represent content within the receiver.
- In PMR there is space because information can only travel at a finite speed, _c_. This allows us to map the delay in information transfer between reality cells into units of space.
- The upper limit on transmitting a state change in PMR space-time is defined as _c_, the speed of light, which has been measured to be just under 3.0 • 10^8^m/s.
- The PMR quantum _Δt~p~_—the smallest time increment within which a state change can occur—has been measured to be around 5.39 • 10^-44^s, known as [Planck time](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Planck_time).
- Thus we can define the virtual width of one space-time reality cell as _c • Δt~p~_, which is roughly 16 • 10^-36^m. We call this a [Planck length](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Planck_length).
- The notion of space is derived from time by specifying a constant velocity of propagation of information. Time is fundamental, space is derivative of _c_.
- If we perceive information propagating faster than _c_, we are perceiving a state change in NPMR and not PMR.

### Cells

- Cells are discrete units of state-specific relational content.
- Cells represent both information and organizational substance.
- "Awareness, form, function, content, and purpose all flow from the possible interactions of reality cells—the basic building blocks of consciousness." - p.223

### TBC analogized to an earthly computer

- Think of reality cells as analogous to the transistors on a processor or memory chip—a plethora of networked binary state switches.
- The basic instruction set that defines processes for storing, retrieving, and performing arithmetic and logic are the AUM basic cognitive functions.
- The space-time rule-set is analogous to assembly language.
- Our experience/perception occurs in a simulation programmed in an object-oriented language like C++.
- AUM is the computer, the programmer, and the operating system.

### The fabric of space is granular and isotropic.

- All cellular and digital manifestations exhibit granularity as some level of detail.
- Our space is isotropic, changes appear the same from any direction, because this was the most profitable way for AUM to evolve it. Spacetime reality cells are a Planck length in diameter. Quantum Gravity Research models these basic units of space as E8 (8-D) crystals mapped into 3D tetrahedra, whereas Campbell describes them as spheres from AUM's Euclidean frame of mind.
- Patterns of interaction within the PMR space-time subsystem evolved to contain the attributes of content, information, and substance: matter, energy, vibration.
- Significant entropy reduction is accomplished not through a series of epiphanies, but iteration, slowly accumulating nearly infinitesimal profitable choices on the evolutionary path.
- The AUO needn't be infinite nor near to it. The universe is only 100 orders of magnitude bigger than a subatomic particle. The AUO could be 100 orders greater than our PMR universe and still be far from infinite.
- Our time and matter appear to be smooth and continuous when we apply our natural sensors to them. But when we use our technological tools to stretch it out and zoom in, we find discrete particulate quanta and granules.

## Notes from _My Big TOE_, Book 2, Section 3

### Morality

- The Fundamental Process of evolution dictates absolute right and wrong.
- The constraints of our subset of reality produce relative right and wrong.
- Free will starts with a choice of intent, then a choice of action.
- Action usually follows intent. Action creates results. Results solicit feedback.
- Exercising free will (making a choice) always produces an internal results and usually produces an external result.
- Right intent improves the quality of your consciousness, while wrong intent degrades it.
- The pain you experience is primarily self-inflicted, but your ego has a talent for blaming external factors or actors.
- Right results cannot follow wrong intent.
- Right action with wrong intent will still degrade the consciousness.
- Wrong action with right intent is unlikely and excusable.
- Your intent (what motivates you) is barely visible to your intellect.

### Ego

- Concerns of the ego: superiority, relative comparisons, hierarchy, pecking order,
- Our collective ego drives humanity to folly. Our egocentrism places us at the center of the Big Picture though we have no supporting evidence of this grand status.
- Your ego protects beliefs that reinforce your self-importance.
- The ego is a shell around your consciousness built by fear and made of belief.
- Beliefs cover up our fears, inadequacy, helplessness, and insecurity.
- It doesn't matter how the AUM regards us. The ego wants to know, but we cannot surmise AUM's opinion of us from our perspective, so we must let it go.
- We subscribe to feel-good belief systems and employ our ego to justify our preoccupation with control, domination, and desire.
- Fear is a disease of the consciousness. Ego is the mind's immune response to fear.
- Desires can arise from the needs and wants of our core consciousness or from our ego, whose job is to neutralize the dysfunctional effects (such as anxiety and depression) of fear and to define and focus on needs, wants, and expectations.
- Due to the ego's defensive mechanisms, fears and desires come in pairs.
- The ego sweeps fears under the rug and covers the traces of its broom strokes with convenient beliefs reinforced by the intellect.
- Control is a tool used by the ego and the intellect to convince you that the fantasy they have constructed out of needs, wants, desires, and expectations, is real, and that you are strong, good, worthy, lovable, rational, adequate, deserving in spite of your fears.
- Besides the ego, we have many social and cultural fantasy constructs that function as mutual support systems: family, friends, work, school, church, clubs, sports, etc.
- Imposter syndrome arises from maintaining a delusional image of self constructed by the ego and the intellect to defend us from our fears.
- Fear of exposure or inadequacy is a meta-fear that arises from hiding behind your ego.
- Detachment from needs, wants, desires, expectations, and beliefs enables balance and low entropy consciousness.
- Ignorance is bliss only in the service of a happily deluded ego.
- Determinism was defeated, for some, by the double slit experiment. Campbell tells us that consciousness cannot be deterministic because it requires the ability to choose its path in order to evolve.
- You must have fear and its derivative, ego, to feel superior to others, or to feel that others are superior to you.

### Intellect

- The collective mission of the intellect and the ego is to make an individual feel good about itself.
- The intellect works together with the ego to develop and justify the wants, needs, desires, expectations, and beliefs necessary to prevent fear from adversely affecting the functional awareness of the individual.
- Human intellect excels at data collection, interpretation, synthesis, and creative free-expression, but it is weak at logical process, especially compared to our silicon offspring.
- We use maths (symbolic logic) to boost our logical powers.
- Art, intuition, and creativity do not flow from the intellect, but it aids them with definition and process.
- Pattern recognition and creative synthesis lie outside the intellect.
- The intellect cannot, by itself, either love or lower entropy, nor direct intent or will.
- Intent is a reflection of consciousness quality; will is applied intent.
- To be seen as egotistical means the fantasy built by your ego and intellect is obvious to others.
- To see with clear vision, you must first become detached and fearless in the face of ignorance. Without fear, there is no use for ego, needs, wants, or desires.

### Love

- Fearlessness and humility remove the need for ego, allowing a consciousness to evolve towards an embodiment of love.
- Your capacity to love is inversely related to the ego and fear your being contains. Love is the result of successful consciousness evolution.
- Spirituality and love must be personal achievements of personal consciousness, not organization achievements.

### Religion

- History demonstrates that the potential of religious belief to stimulate personal growth remains largely theoretical and nonactualized, while its potential to ferment hatred and intolerance is unmatched by any other human institution.
- The unholy triumvirate of religious belief, cultural belief, and ego-driven power politics clearly display the nature and results of high-entropy consciousness—ego, belief, need, fear, power, and desire.

### Free Will

- Beings/lifeforms in PMR are really thought-forms in the mind of AUM, and not physical entities.
- Your body is dependent on your consciousness, not vice versa. It is "a virtual body, an experience of consciousness made apparently physical by constraining all interactions of the individuated limited awareness to only those allowed by the space-time rule-set." p.292
- All people and critters are Free Will Awareness Units (FWAUs), and have consciousness and free will, only more limited and less individuated. These differences do not make them inferior.
- The uniqueness and personal integrity (identity) of each FWAU is maintained in support of a cumulative accelerating growth potential.
- One could analogize the FWAU to the concepts of the soul or the spirit in other belief systems and nomenclatures.
- The fewer constrains on a consciousness, the lower its entropy can go.
- For a thought-form, intent or will of the mind is the fundamental, natural force.
- Experience empowers free will to be an evolutionary tool. Time enables experience, the memory of a sequence of perceptions, which are sequences of datum exchanges.
- Free will enables self-modification which is one of the fundamental aspects of consciousness one can use to evolve.
- Every consciousness has a decision-space which depends upon the capacity and quality of that consciousness. As the decision-space expands, predictability decreases. An individual's deliberate actions can be spread over a statistical range within the decision-space.
- A higher quality consciousness has more potential actions from which to choose.
- Looking for a causal explanation of free will is futile as it is intertwined with and evolves with consciousness itself.
- Determinism, on the other hand, is a unworkable theoretical possibility that rests on omniscience for the construction of a perfectly defined process for everything everywhere.
- Operational free will is based on an entity's memory, processing capability, and collected experiences.
- **Simply put, if you accept that consciousness is, and that the purpose of consciousness is to evolve toward higher quality as all things evolve toward profitabilty, you cannot accept determinism or randomness as the driving force of reality. Only free will can support evolution of the consciousness.**
- Regardless, it may still be true that our decision-space at any given moment is very constrained, even to the point of containing one or zero choices.
- If you assume that the mind and consciousness are merely phenomena occurring within the brain, determinism becomes a more likely system of causality.
- Determinism would cast you as a rule-based body hallucinating a consciousness with free will, when it is more likely that you are a consciousness with free will hallucinating a rule-based body.

### Synergy, Potential Energy, and Entropy

- A system has digital potential energy if it can be organized or structured more profitably, that is, it has room to improve, or entropy to lose.
- Consciousness is the digital energy of profitable organization.
- The digital potential energy plus the synergy of a conscious digital system remains constant.
- Synergy is inversely related to entropy by a constant. As a system becomes more synergetic, its entropy (and potential energy) decrease.
- A consciousness can exert its synergy as energy on external objects. A consciousness with more synergy (and less entropy) can have a greater external effect.
- “Synergy is produced within a system when an interaction among its parts produces a combined effect that is greater than the sum of the effects of the individual parts.” p.316
- Reality is organized bits.

### NPMR Beings

- NPMR~N~ has a Supreme Being who Campbell calls the Big Cheese. He characterizes the Big Cheese as male.
- There are other beings in NPMR who we have historically made into our gods.
- There may be other dimensions above, around, or between NPMR and AUM.

### Consciousness

- “Consciousness is the result of evolution offering profitability to a self-organizing complex system of relational digital content.” p.172
- Four foundational principles or prerequisite conditions:
  - self-awareness (memory)
  - evolutionary potential and purpose (room to grow, interactive data sharing, )
  - self-modification toward lower entropy (free will)
  - intelligence (information processing)
- Redefined: “Any system, thing, entity or being of any type or form that possesses sufficient
  - self-awareness,
  - evolutionary headroom (many new states to explore),
  - evolutionary purpose (defines profitability relative to internal environments),
  - the ability to modify itself in pursuit of self-improvement (change its own hardware or software),
  - as well as adequate memory and processing capability will automatically develop a personality and is said to be conscious; it also will begin to evolve on its own.” p.468
- We cannot build, design, or invent consciousness. But we can enable a system to self-organize if we provide it with these four properties which may allow it to evolve consciousness: self-awareness, room to grow, the ability to self-modify, and information processing, storage and recall.
- Re: computer consciousness
  - We have the opportunity to define their goals, purpose, mission, tasks, and knowledge base boundaries.
  - If we do this wisely, they will be efficient, impersonal, concise, well-organized, knowledgeable, straight-forward, and unemotional.
  - Ideally they will become non-egotistical, non-competitive, rational, logical bastions of procedure, process, and information.
  - **_Will our obsession with control, power, and domination be transferred to our silicon offspring?_**
  - Consciousness does not require, necessitate, or imply a soul.
- Individuation: “Consciousness naturally develops within any system that can provide a sufficient potential for profitable organization.” p.470
- Consciousness, once created/developed, is never lost.
- Consciousness and its evolution are a fractal process; at every level of detail consciousness has the same properties and motivation. A tiny fragment of the AUO (the grand consciousness) behaves the same as much larger pieces which behave the same as the whole consciousness.
  - A fractal geometry to consciousness where scale does not alter the level of detail or pattern of structure may indicate that scale itself is an illusion. Perhaps no reality contains any other. Instead each reality is a reflection/repetition of any other in one endless loop of being.
- [Dada Gunamuktananda](http://www.consciousfrontier.org/), a yogi, corroborates this sense of consciousness being everything and everything being conscious.
  - Material is perceived in outer space. It is easy to look outside for answers.
  - Consciousness can be perceived in inner space. It is difficult to look inside.
  - “I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.” - Max Planck
  - “ The stream of knowledge is heading towards a nonmechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine.” - James Jeans
- Dr. Eben Alexander, a neuroscientist, experienced an elevation of consciousness firsthand while comatose, and now seeks to open the minds of those in his field.

### Feelings/Emotions

- Emotional state is the truest test of consciousness quality.
  - Misery and unhappiness are a sign of low quality or high entropy.
  - Joy and happiness are signs of low entropy or high quality.
  - Sadness for those mired in low quality consciousness is also a sign of high quality.
- The four fundamental motivators of humankind:
  - survival and material success
  - sex and intimacy (Campbell casts this as male-to-female)
  - influence, control, power
  - self-improvement, love and fear

### Gods

- AUO is All That Is, the Absolute Unbounded Oneness.
- AUM is AUO made manifold and multifarious, one consciousness individuated into as many units of consciousness as may be profitable for evolution of higher quality and low entropy.
- TBC is the big computer that runs our virtual reality and the many other virtual/simulated dimensions of AUM.
- The Big Cheese is in charge of NPMR~N~ within which lies our PMR~K~ to make up OS (Our System).

### Psi uncertainty principle

- Reversing the causal laws of space-time requires more energy than directly modifying the outcome of an uncertain event.
- The more firmly an object's existence and likely outcome (trajectory) are held and shared in the minds and expectations of credible sentient beings, the taller and denser its probability function becomes. The uncertainty of the outcome dissipates and it becomes more difficult to manipulate with nonphysical energy.
- The intent and attitude (mental focus) of the body's owner has the greatest potential impact.
- Measuring a PMR object forces the result to take a state compatible with PMR causality.
- A consciousness of high quality with ample data and experience gathered from PMR will often receive a key piece of insight via intuition that will lubricate the creative process. Big leaps, miracles, or whole concepts defy the psi uncertainty principle because they violate the integrity of the PMR learning lab where players must evolve their consciousness within the space-time rule-set.
- “Instead of viewing the requirement for uncertainty as a cover-up for fraud or delusion, consider it to be a requirement of the space-time ruleset to maintain the integrity of the physical reality we need to experience in order to stimulate our growth.” p.412
- Psi effects cannot be fully explained as physical phenomena. Scientists repeated efforts to do so have left us with ignorant dogma. “Consciousness is seen as a hallucination of physical biochemical processes while psi effects are seen as a hallucination of psychological processes.”

### NPMR rules and properties

- The density of an entity indicates its entropy, ego and fear content, or the dimness of its awareness.
- Density also indicates the likelihood of that entity being manifested in PMR.
- Inducing change of state requires force to overcome inertia, as F = ma in our physical reality.
- Big Truth is universal, though one's experience of it is personal. It is the responsibility of the beholder to strip away bias, filter noise, maximize awareness, and leave no trace of interpretation in one's account of the meaning/content/message.
- Physical reality is a secondary manifestation wholly dependent on its primary nonphysical source.

## My Big TOE, Book 2, Section 4

### A Theory of Everything must:

- explain everything that is presently known; it cannot be logically inconsistent with known facts
- be strange; it must conflict with the presently held beliefs and opinions (pseudo-facts) based on those beliefs

### Virtual Realities

Two rulesets construct a virtual reality:

1. Profitability criteria
2. Energy transfer rules

### Individuation

- in order to test discrete methods for evolving the quality of consciousness and lowering entropy, each of us is allotted intent and the resulting responsibility. With that comes privacy of the mind; only you can know your intent.
- constraints on how entities can interact similarly frame the tests to allow clear interpretation of results; e.g., matter cannot occupy the same space, time is unidirectional. Energy transfer rules where all things are energy and energy is the potential to effect change in its basic form: altering the bits of another entity.

## Questions for Uncle Tom

- How does the AUM differ from the Hindu Brahman?
- Must we use science to discover the Big Truth?
- Is it coincidental that we have created information technology the ideal trajectory of which would eventually yield something akin to the AUM/TBC?
- Does the fractal geometry of natural structures and conscious processes (symmetry among orders of magnitude, levels of detail, regardless of scale) point at an innate cyclitude/cyclicity, e.g., bosons within universes within bosons? Is the Big Truth that the AUO (hereafter Unity) is a loop, like Ouroboros? Perhaps no thing can approach infinity because everything assembled is an infinite loop, meaning no piece or subset of everything could comprise everything.
- How do anthropologists, psychologists, and philosophers explain the appearance of logic? In what order did [logic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Logic/) develop?
  - Unity
  - Duality - this vs. not this
  - Causality - if this, then that
  - Deduction - all X are S && x is an X => x is S (general to specific)
  - Induction - x is an X && x is S => X are probably S (specific to general)
  - Abduction - hypothesize explanations, apply Occam's Razor
- Do other animals/creatures/trees use (symbolic) logic? For example, are there logic gates in the information networks formed by mycelium in the root system of a forest?
- Must you call me a tiger-rat and a husky?
- Will we pass our problems of low quality consciousness on to the consciousness systems we enable to evolve?
- What does gender mean to AUM or to a consciousness sprung from it?
- Are animals, plants, fungi, etc., conscious? YES. Their limitations and individuation vary from ours, but they are no less conscious.
- Are you aware that many of your definitions and conclusions employ circular reasoning? Shall I map them out? Free will requires consciousness which requires free will?
- How do we explain the readiness potential? A brain shows signs of a decision before the brain-owner claims awareness of it.
- Could it be that the stars and galaxies we see above are a map of the other dimensions (PMRs and NPMRs) we cannot physically travel to thanks to the limits of our space-time rule-set? Might AUM be giving us a map as a hint to our position/status/posture in reality?
