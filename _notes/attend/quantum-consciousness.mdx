title: Quantum Consciousness

# Quantum Consciousness

- Russel Targ talks of Distant Viewing or Remote Viewing
- Manifestation requires attention (a conscious observer)
- Unobserved segments/spans of spacetime do not exist in manifested/material [[reality]]
- The domain of possibility allows quanta to leap.
  - Packets of information may appear to travel faster than light in the manifest domain.
  - Leaps are guided by a choice and witnessed by an observer: [[intention]] and [[attention]] at work.
