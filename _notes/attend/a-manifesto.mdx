# A Manifesto

- We set our [[intent]] to choose our [[experience]].
- We aim to [[feel]] good until everything connects.
- We let [[love]] propel us and guide us.
- We win as we evolve. #evolution
- We [[play]] nice.
- When we notice it, we shed [[fear]], [[want]], [[need]], [[expectation]], and [[belief]].
- We peel the [[ego]].
  - No delusions allowed.
- We pay [[attention]].
- We unearth the [[truth]].
- We connect the dots, and navigate by number.
- We go with the flow.
  - Sailing beats paddling.
- We continue to open and loosen our [[mind]].
  - The answers lie inside.
- We are skeptical.
  - We question everything with compassion.
- We are patient with Ourself.
- There is no hurry.
- This is just a game.
- It's not serious.
- The only object is our enjoyment.
- We find [[bliss]] and share what we [[love]].
- We have everything in common.
- [[cnxns]] is everything.
