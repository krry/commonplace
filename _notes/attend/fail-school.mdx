# Fail School

I may have to transcribe some zany pages from the 5-color notebook to explain this.

The jist is simple: a place to learn how to fail with others from experts.

## Why do I want to learn how to fail?

Because failing and getting back up correlates highly with success.
And it's **way** easier than not failing and then succeeding.
Tuition is free if you get a friend or fam or fram to attend.
