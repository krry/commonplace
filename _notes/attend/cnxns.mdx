# CNXNS

- aka:: Spirit, Atman, Brahman, Sat·Chit·Ananda, I Am, All-that-is, What-is, The Cosmic Egg, Ouroboros, a Strange Loop
- def:: The subjective [[experience]] of the ultimate, unchanging [[reality]]
- etymology:: from the Latin **conscire** meaning "to know with others or in oneself"
- [[2018-05-11]]
  - According to Uncle [[paraphrasing-campbell]] with the mighty [[notes-on-my-big-toe]], the Absolute Unbounded Oneness (AUO) is the apparently infinite source of our larger [[reality]].
    - AUO is simultaneously everything and nothing, all potential and no differentiation.
    - When AUO differentiates as it follows the Fundamental Process of [[evolution]] toward higher [[quality]] and lower [[entropy]], AUO becomes Absolute Unbounded Manifold (AUM). #[[tao-te-ching]]
      - AUM is functionally Consciousness in its true, whole form.
      - We are individuated differentiations of AUM.
  - According to [[steve-kaufman]], CNXNS is [[existence]] coming to exist in relation to itself. It is absolutely everywhere and thus nowhere.
    - When CNXNS is localized to somewhere relative to somewhere else, it becomes [[awareness]].
    - CNXNS is [[unbound]], borderless, undefined existence driven by unconditional [[love]] to evolve and differentiate so it can [[experience]] and enjoy itself.
    - "[C]onsciousness evolves into the awareness of experience by repetitively and progressively forming relationships with itself."
    - Consciousness has localized, individuated, and differentiated (to borrow the nomenclature of [[steve-kaufman]]) into innumerable forms.
      - It is our charge, as points of awareness to recognize and interact with each other with love for the enjoyment of the spirit we share.
      - Anywhere you see attention being paid or set intent exercised, there is someone to meet, something to understand, a potential playmate.
      - Any drop of awareness can become internally reflective and lose sight of its true nature, so we cannot expect every one to know ourself and to be playful.
        - But love breeds love, so lead with that.
  - If Consciousness is a diamond then we nodes of awareness are its facets.
    - You cannot perceive or experience consciousness as a whole, as absolute existence, because you are consciousness and are not relative to it in order to [[experience]] it. #relativity
  - If Consciousness is an ocean, then you are a single drop of that ocean water swimming in the ocean.
  - Consciousness is the only thing and everything, yet indefinable and inexperienceable, thus not a thing. #no-thing
  - In the West, medicine and neuroscience consider consciousness to be "a state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings".
  - [[Antonio Damasio]] offers a three-tiered model of CNXNS in which
    - any being that responds to its environment in its own interest qualifies for the first tier: the **Protoself**
      - Even single-celled organisms, even viruses, possess a Protoself.
      - From my perspective, even a lick of awareness is enough to get you in the consciousness club. I stand with Giulio Tononi and the proponents of [[integrated-information-theory]] who mathematically model and measure the consciousness of any contour of spacetime as a quantity phi ɸ.
        - There is no arbitrary bar above which beings (or contours) are conscious and below which they are just quirky and randomly wiggling.
    - Life-forms that have a sense of self in the present moment or projected into the past and the future are even more conscious. (This is more accurately termed [[self-consciousness]].)
  - According to Anil Seth, the CNXNS of any being has:
    - a **level** between dead and hyperconscious (which might be psychotic, epileptic, or autistic, etc.),
    - **content** in the form of sensations and predictions that comprise perception, and
    - a **sense of self** that may be physical, perspectival, volitional, narrative, or social.
