# Reading Aeon

Here is a journal of responses to articles from [Aeon](https://aeon.co/) and its minded subsidiary Psyche.

## ["Thoughts into Words"](https://aeon.co/essays/what-comes-first-ideas-or-words-the-paradox-of-articulation)

by [Eli Alshanetsky](https://aeon.co/users/eli-alshanetsky)

"Hereâ€™s the paradox of articulation: are you excavating existing ideas, or do your thoughts come into being as you speak?"

The author notices responses to experiences occurring before they have words attached. Could these be not thoughts at all, but rather feelings, senses, intuition?

Gurdjieff's model of the seven centers of a (human) being allows us to piece apparent the experience of conscious awareness into spheres or realms that each center around an ability:

1. Moving
2. Sensing
3. Feeling
4. Thinking
5. Sex
6. Higher feeling
7. Higher thinking

This is a convenient model for the analytical mind that must needs disintegrate, dismantle, sort, categorize, classify what we perceive. Really though our experience of being has no one witness to discretely reside in one center at a time. We are not only thinking one moment, then only feeling. The atom of being might comprise a point of awareness paying attention according to an intention.
