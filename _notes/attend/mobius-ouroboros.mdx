# Möbius Ouroboros

- Reality Loops Around
  - Consciousness develops from existence then forgets, crumbles and starts over
  - ø to ♾ and back again
  - #[[Œ]]
- Start anywhere along the chain of meta-development:
  - [[life]]
    - having the desire and ability to choose
  - [[resonance]]
    - witnessing the impact of our choices in order to inform the next ones
  - [[meaning]]
    - directing our choices toward a particular sense of desired resonance
  - [[evolution]]
    - containing many meanings in order to persist as the world changes
  - [[knowing]]
    - effortless recall of evolved, meaningful, resonant states of relation
  - [[CNXNS]]
    - the directed pursuit of knowing to resolve innate, default ignorance
  - [[understanding]]
    - a humbling breadth of knowledge, returning the learner to child mind
  - [[wisdom]]
    - a depth of understand that keeps one floating at the surface
  - [[self]]
    - a drop of the ocean and the whole ocean in a single drop
  - ø
    - empty set, null set, nada, nothing, no-thing, what's inside a point
    - nihil, nadir, zero, zed, 0
  - ♾
    - everything, the second half of Œ, th-th-th-that's-all-folkth, omni, pan, toto
    - all possibilities swimming in a formless, boundless, timeless cloud nowhere and everywhere waiting to collapse into manifested experience at a moment's notice by any conscious observer in any plane of existence
    - a.k.a. the [[source]]
  - [[existence]]
    - the veil between what could be and what is
    - does essence precede existence or vice versa? let the French existentialists debate this while we go on like chickens born of eggs made by chickens
  - [[oneness]]
    - at first all that is is all that could be in one big "Hmmmmm"
    - liang the loop encircling the [[Tao]]
  - [[ignorance]]
    - the loop leaves space and nothing but
  - asking
    - what am I? the questions begin with wonder
  - [[relativity]]
    - answers and questions arise from relation
  - comparison
    - big defines small by comparison
  - learning
    - commuting relations enriches the tapestry
  - [[quality]]
    - a quality arises along with its mutual balancing/canceling opposite
    - see also:: [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]
    - quality emerges from the delicate [awareness, acknowledge, acceptance]([[AAA]]) of the grand duality
  - value
    - the presence of multiple qualities provides an opportunity for preference
    - e.g., too hot, not wet enough, over fed
  - striving
    - value judgment brings lack and abundance
  - quantity
    - lacking inspires counting and accounting
    - no tax collectors or money lenders in the temple, God!
    - see also:: [[usury-is–the-fruit-of-all-evil]]
  - complexity
    - counting this and counting that carry different meaning
    - scales often differ and overlap in layers and spheres of complexity
    - see also:: Bruce Lipton's theory of life as enveloping membranes
  - experiment
    - understanding many layers of complexity at once requires a fictive space
    - ceteris paribus, holding all other pieces equal or steady, what is happening?
  - spacetime
    - any experiment takes place in spacetime
    - but space is time and vice versa, so which whenwhere were we when we were where?
  - parameters
    - many dimensions may blossom by setting a few integral parameters
      - like the ratio of a circle's perimeter to its cross-section aka π
      - or the gravitational constant we observe the keeps the heavens swinging
      - how fast does light go?
  - possibilities
    - once the basics are twiddled, we can open up the field of imagination
  - rulesets
    - a few baseline rules might help this universe to be a keeper
    - do we have non-being and being? how many turns do you get?
  - big bang
    - blammo. let's go. let it unfold.
  - vibrations
    - with all the calibrating we did before the bang, things are pretty well figured
      - we can now sit back and watch the show
  - events
    - the show is an N-dimensional network of events all interconnected and cocreating
  - data
    - the events generate data as we observe them
    - endless tiny yesses and nos
  - randomness
    - slicing across the field, we encounter a senseless mishmash of data
    - without knowing the observers, choosers, actors, it seems random
  - information
    - in truth every actor, observer, chooser is neatly in form
    - those in form set to work shaping what is not in form in the [[domain-of-possibility]]
  - energy
    - the work of shaping possibility into reality is fueled by energy
    - energy can be collected and dispersed according to intention and attention
  - matter
    - clusters of concentrated energy become matter, storing potential energy
    - these chunks tend to think they are important
  - cosmos
    - between matter and energy we pretty much entail the cosmos
    - and we elect to play a small part in the cosmic play
  - life
    - wherein we adopt the ability to choose, free will
    - which is enacted by intention that follows our attention
