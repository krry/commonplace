# We live to dance and dance to live

As we examine the phenomenon and practice of movement under the Love or Fear lens, we find that rhythmic, responsive movement to be a fundamental characteristic exhibited by living beings.

We move out of love, toward love, with love, and to make love. Many of our most rhythmic and harmonious movement practices are our most loving. The amorous couple through the hotel room wall tend to have excellent rhythm. Massage of any school has a certain dance to it, a flow all its own. And breathing, our most familiar dance, feels best when it is deep and full and steady, feeding our heart, the constant tiny dancer inside each of us, who conducts the orchestra of organs, tissues, and cells within us all wiggling and pulsing and quivering to keep our water gelled [[structured-water]], our membranes luscious, and our solids in delicate balance.
