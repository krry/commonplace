# Full Smile in a page

Where healers play
A school of self-healing
A coplaying space for healers
A co-healing space to play
A co-playing space to self-heal

## The Problem

We suffer. We look outward for remedies, treatments, medicine. We are addicted to grasping, junkies for control. We work ourselves to death for the spectre of progress. We don't love ourselves.

## The Solution

A safe cozy fun space for healers to pause and play as we learn and teach each other how to heal ourselves.

## The Strategy

There are many approaches to healing, from qigong to reiki, yoga to thai massage, cardio to cayenne cleanses, cryo tanks and float tanks.

We'll invite healers to dance what feels good, play any agreeable way, and track our well-being as we go.

## Phases

1. Gather healers to play, share knowledge, and resolve on the first principles of self-healing.
