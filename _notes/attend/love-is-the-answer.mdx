# Love is the Answer

To the paradoxes that confound us
like why the weather is so
To our insatiable dissatisfaction
like why I can't stop drinking
To the quandaries that plague us
like why money doesn't grow on trees
To the dilemmas that halt us
like how to save our marriage
To the mysteries that follow us
like why bacon goes with everything
To the quagmires that swamp us
like this mountain of debt
To our chronic unrest
that I stay up worrying about
To the conundra that drive us on
like how to juggle all these crises
To any question worth asking
like "[[What is worth doing?]]"
or "What should we make?"
Love is the answer
