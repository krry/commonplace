# The Learning Ladder

- Data => Information => Knowledge => Insight => Understanding => Wisdom
- Noise becomes [[data]] when we collect it/them.
- [[data]] becomes [[information]] as we glean [[meaning]] through our senses to form a perception of local [[reality]]. These meaning making [[experiences]] of subjectivity are [[qualia]].
- [[information]] becomes [[knowledge]] as we recall, describe, name, explain, record, classify into [[taxonomy]] our [[qualia]], so that others may compare their experiences to ours.
- [[knowledge]] becomes [[understanding]] as we collect, combine, distill, cull, interpolate, and extrapolate our knowledge into models, lexicons, theory, postulates, principles, axioms, and such that anyone can apply to new and old experiences.
- [[insight]] arises spontaneously as knowledge and understanding [[information]] new [[experience]].
- Wisdom develops through the personal application of knowledge, insight, and understanding.
  - Wisdom often arises when we place trust in intuition.
  - [[tom-campbell]] says: [[wisdom]] arises from the patient, non-judgmental contemplation of the challenges we face and the skeptical, open-minded evaluation of the results of applying our understanding, knowledge, and insight.
