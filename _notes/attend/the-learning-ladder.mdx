# The Learning Ladder

- Data => Information => Knowledge => Insight => Understanding => Wisdom
- Noise becomes [[data]] when we collect it/them.
- [Data]([[data]]) becomes [[information]] as we glean [[meaning]] through our senses to form a perception of local [[reality]]. These meaning making [[experiences]] of subjectivity are [[qualia]].
- [Information]([[information]]) becomes [[knowledge]] as we recall, describe, name, explain, record, [classify]([[taxonomy]]) our [[qualia]], so that others may compare their experiences to ours.
- [Knowledge]([[knowledge]]) becomes [[understanding]] as we collect, combine, distill, cull, interpolate, and extrapolate our knowledge into models, lexicons, theory, postulates, principles, axioms, and such that anyone can apply to new and old experiences.
- [Insight]([[insight]]) arises spontaneously as knowledge and understanding [inform]([[information]]) new [[experiences]].
- Wisdom develops through the personal application of knowledge, insight, and understanding.
  - Wisdom often arises when we place trust in intuition.
  - [Ol' Uncle Tom]([[Tom Campbell]]) says: [Wisdom]([[wisdom]]) arises from the patient, non-judgmental contemplation of the challenges we face and the skeptical, open-minded evaluation of the results of applying our understanding, knowledge, and insight.
