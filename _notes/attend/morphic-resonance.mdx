# Morphic Resonance

A theory formulated by [[rupert-sheldrake]] wherein all we observe comprises a field of morphic resonance. Contours of vibration interwoven, harmonizing, echoing, remixing, and sometimes clashing cacophonously.

Explains [[protein-folding]], [[telepathic-dogs]], [[intuition]], feeling watched, etc.
