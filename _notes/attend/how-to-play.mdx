# How To Play

## Characters

- You are [[atman]].
- Everyone else is also Atman.

## Mission

- Your mission is to navigate and evolve with love.

## Purpose

- We intend to fundamentally improve your understanding of whom you are, how you got here, what your purpose is (and isn't), and what to do about it.

## Direction

- Please pay [[attention]] as you play.
  - We ask for your "sole and undivided attention".
  - The more [[attention]] you pay, the greater the impact this experience will have.
- Jump around!
  - As a [[sovereign]] [[being]], you choose where to direct your attention, and I encourage you to do so playfully and with love and patience.
  - I have constructed this meta-game of [[the-game]] as a reading [[experience]] where you determine the structure of the narrative by following the hyperlinks strewn throughout the text.
- Go outside and play.
  - [[the-game]] is not contained herein. You have been playing [[the-game]] the whole [[time]]! This is only a reference to and resource for [[the-game]].
  - We hope this [[roam]] through [[atmanautica]] will enlighten your load, loosen your mind, and inform your choices throughout the manifold realms of your life.
- Mind your score
  - The resources here ought to help you roughly estimate and optimize your score. [[More Isn't Better]]
- Get Real!
