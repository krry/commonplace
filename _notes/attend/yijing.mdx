# Yìjīng

- 易經 (pinyin: Yìjīng) called I Ching in the west
- My main resources for Yìjīng while building [[nameless]] have been:
  - the Wilhelm/Barnes translation/interpretation
  - [Zelda Hessler's Rust I Ching](https://github.com/Velfi/i-ching)
  - [Hilary Barrett's Online Clarity](https://www.onlineclarity.co.uk)
  - [Russell Cottrell's Virtual Yarrow Stalks](http://www.russellcottrell.com/VirtualYarrowStalks/)
