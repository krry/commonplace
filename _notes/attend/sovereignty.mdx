# Sovereignty

As I explore sovereignty, my spirit soars. Surely these are the flags along the path to liberation.

Some musings thus far include:

- [[existing-as-sovereign]]
- [[identity-or-sovereignty]]
- [[shall-we-advance-proceed-be]]
- [[how-to-be-sovereign]]
- and even a budding [[self-sovereign-manifesto]].

Oh and a poem or two. [[breathe-and-stop]] touches on sovereignty.
