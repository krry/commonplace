# How to Do Philosophy Communally

from [The Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/does-philosophy-belong-to-the-academy-or-the-community-1.4271491), interviewing the authors of Philosophy and Community: Theories, Practices and Possibilities (Bloomsbury), UK academics Amanda Fulford, Grace Lockrobin and Richard Smith:

"Philosophy inoculates against tribalism, they argue, and it raises the quality of public debate."

"We expect that the contributions made in such [community philosophy] dialogues should be cogent, well-reasoned, non-contradictory and consistent with our other views."

Community philosophy discussions "broaden our individual perspectives and increase our sensitivity to the humanity of others."

“When we ask questions such as: ‘What makes me, me?’, ‘Is there anything more important than happiness?’, or ‘Should I be afraid to die?’, we are asking questions that almost any professional philosopher – past or present – would recognise as philosophical.

“These are also questions that almost any human being could begin to address."

Why philosophy isn't taught in schools when STEM is?

"One suspicion we have is that neoliberal priorities have skewed education policy towards science, technology, engineering and maths as drivers of capitalism. The arts and the humanities more generally, and philosophy specifically, do not fare well on the metric of money making.

“The question we really need to ask is what is education for children and for adults ultimately for? But this is, of course, a philosophical question and the more philosophy is devalued, the less well-equipped each new generation is to answer this question for themselves – to see beyond the narrow economic argument and towards bigger picture in which making music, playing sport and doing philosophy together are vital parts of education and a life worth living.”
