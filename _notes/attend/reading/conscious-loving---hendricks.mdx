# Conscious Loving

## Essential Co-Commitments
1. I commit to being close.
2. I commit to total responsibility for my relationships.
3. I commit to fully revealing myself.
4. I commit to fully empowering of others.
5. I commit to fully developing myself.
6. I commit to enjoying my relationships.

## Requirements for Conscious Loving
- Feel all your feelings
	- Locate them in your body
	- Feel them to completion
- Tell the microscopic truth
- Keep your agreements

## Beware the Upper Limits Problem

When overloaded with positive energy, take some space and time to absorb and recalibrate. Don't self-sabotage to restore balance.

I observe myself when feeling good. I watch for the shift to numbness or the turn to argument.

## Be aware of projection

I claim 100% responsibility for my reality and my relationships.

## Scatter the ash

After powerful transformations, I shake it off, I dance, I breathe deeply to shed and scatter the ash.

## Resolving Conflict

1. How do I feel? (Specifically, in my body.)
2. What do I want? (Flip complaints into requests.)
3. How is the past coloring my present?
4. What am I getting out of staying stuck?
5. What do I need to say?
6. What agreements have I broken?
7. How can I be of service?

## Resolving Stuckness
1. Whose voice says "I'm stuck"?
2. Where do I feel stuckness in my body?
3. When else have I felt this way?
4. What can I learn from feeling stuck in this way?
5. Who do I need to talk to about it?
6. Who can I trust to walk with me out of the quicksand?
