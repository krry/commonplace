# Reading The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle

## Notes from the inner covers

Hurdle the anxiety gap from _cogito_ to _sum_.\
Feel the truth where mind and body meet.\
Shatter your fragile ego.\
Leave danger behind in your mind.\
and flee the fear in the pain-body.

Sit in the ever-now,\
watching the thinker taper off.\
Transmute base metal into gold\
suffering into consciousness,\
disaster into enlightenment.

Disidentify from ego until you are nothing\
but being aware of bliss.\
Confusion cannot be settled by the mind\
that made it up, that invented time.
What in this moment is lacking?\
If not now, when?

Time is ending as we evolve toward being awakened.\
Behind each doing lies fear or glows love.\
Afraid we make problems and time travel to solve them.\
In love we dance and sing and sit in bliss.

What? < How? < Why? < Who?\
Where = Here\
When = Now\
How much = All or nothing

Don't complain.\
Instead speak up, take action, or leave it.

To be suffering-free, we must allow _what is_ to be.

Forgiveness is grief released allowing peace.\
The ego is a sense of self derived from the past.\
The ego, the mind, cannot forgive, only you can.\
You will find the strength to forgive\
in the stillness of your ever-loving heart.

To find the Source, the Unmanifested, the Tao,\
stop and wonder what might be your next thought.\
Or find yourself in ceaseless peace agaze\
into the honeycomb mirrors of a bumbling bee.

Anyhow we can surrender to the stillness,\
anyway we can remember to Be Here Now.

Inside us time is presence,\
in the heart a clock,\
where we tick the first only moment,\
but never a second.

Inside us space is deep as the heavens are\
wide to our upward starry eyes\
seeing the coin at once, both sides,\
is the nameless gift of God to the wise.\

Break up with yourself\
then you're free to love everyone\
sans judgment, pride, or pity.\
Stop dating yourself today.\
Swallow the clock.

Practice surrender:\
Refrain from labeling the Now.\
Let it remain trivial to allow.

All negativity is resistance is the mind.\
Full acceptance is full attention is surrender.\
Go with the flow of life unopposing.

Love has no opposite.
