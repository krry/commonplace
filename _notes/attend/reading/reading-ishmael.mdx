# Reading Ishmael

by Daniel Quinn

WITH MAN/GORILLA GONE
WILL THERE
BE HOPE
FOR GORILLA/MAN

Civilization is captivity

Take it or leave it

Takers are civilized/captive
Leavers are primitive/primal

Take what you can get
Get what you give
Leave and let live

### Definitions

A story is a scenario interrelating human, the world, and the gods.
To enact a story is to live so as to make the story a reality.
A culture is a people enacting a story.

The story of Genesis is a story that casts mankind as the enemy of the world. It says, "The world was made for man and man was made to conquer and rule the world." Complete control is the goal.

## the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil

I am equal to the gods and know what is good and evil like them:
"to grow without limits is good,
to accept the limits of the law is evil."
Hence we shall blanket the earth.

"I am one, my liege, whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incens'd that I am reckless what I do to spite the world."

- Macbeth, No Fear

It took 500 generations to get this perverse, from 8000 YA to today

Story

p. 243:
"...man does have a place in the world, but it's not his place to rule. The gods have that in hand. ... Man's place is to be the first _without being the last_.

"This is what we need. Not just _stopping_ things. Not just _less_ of things. People need something positive to work for. ... They need more than a vision of doom. They need a vision of the world and of themselves that inspires them."

"You must change people's minds."

No need to leave like Leavers.
We live and let live.
Livers transcend Takers.

p. 253: "Breaking out of the Taker prison is a common cause to which all humanity can subscribe."

#### Poem I wrote in the back as I read

The world was made for man
and man was made to rule it.
Man's destiny is total control
of nature with technology
then comes star trek
then comes paradiso
only, no!
man is flawed
and hopelessly so
lawless and flawful
until falling becomes flight
& we soar headshort
into the soapy surf
riding tidal currents
seeing vitals weren't
otterly kneaded doh!
we've had enough!
... all along
diversity ensures survival
we compete to balance up
natural limits are the law
