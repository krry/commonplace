# gravity

[[affinity]], the law of attraction, as expressed by [[matter]].

And with presence, gravity (as affinity, or attraction) is pre-existing between people that like each other. A ideal presence experience allows that gravity to become motion, drawing people together when they are in the right state to interact.
