# We Can Do Better Than This

> In WAITing, we understand ourselves as more than separate individuals. Many voices, each with different motivations and goals, murmur within us and around us: the voice of the ego, the inner child, the higher self; the voice of beings of nature, spirits, and ancestors; the voice of social forces like patriarchy or peace; archetypal voices to which we may be attuned…. Which shall we allow to issue from our mouths or fingertips? Gigi asks, “Which one wants and needs to speak? Which one may be heard and actually serve life, healing, and contribute to more love, truth and wholeness?

What would our inner child have to say if hoisted into the throne room of the higher self?

The sovereign infant needs no words to reign over the well-meaning robots who bore it. Singing for milk, cooing for cuddles, screaming for shiggles, shitting, sleeping it off.

The sovereign child speaks only truth. Then the moment arrives when the child is told "no" and is sent reeling by the possibility. As further entreaties fall on deaf, old ears, the concept of opposites, of a negatory, begins to sink in. "No, I don't want cake!" And no cake is had or eaten. The world of duality is full of terrors and joys, misery and bliss splitting like atoms day in, day out. The child learns to lie when emerging needs (or imagined wants) are left unmet, and quickly loses its sovereign crown as the lies spring roots, then sprout leaves and bear fruits.
