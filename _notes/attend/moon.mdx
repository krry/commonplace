# Moon

We learn that üà∑Ô∏è is used to mean rent, or monthly payment, when once it meant merely 'moon'.
I've compiled the [[meanings-of-cjk-emoji]] in a table to elucidate the consumerist slant of these emoji. Is it a joke on Westerners to make these so shallow and money-focused?

Anyway, what if the Moon eats the souls of Earthlings when they meet their demise? That's one of the zany theories G puts forth in Ouspensky's _In Search of the Miraculous_. G of course being assumed to be, but never explicitly named as the elusive and eminent G.I. [[gurdjieff]].
