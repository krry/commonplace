# Crafting a Tale

I need an outlet for my creativity, and I love to write. However the ideas that occur to me to record and expound are often not easily received as true or earnest. I often find myself in doubt at the most fundamental aspects of reality, in that float tank of possibilities that hides behind my eyes. So why not write fiction?

Without a universally accepted source of truth, who can tell fiction from non? Perhaps I have no choice in the matter. If I write what I see, and what is real is what is experienced, then my non-fiction is gonna be pretty incredible. 

Robert Anton Wilson, from whom I've read little but who seems quite extraordinary, found no use for "is", said he doesn't know what anything "is", only what it appears to be. I tend to agree. But that's a sneaky way to use a word while claiming not to need it. Still, more action, less definition, description, exposition, amirite?

So then fiction? What comprises good fiction? Let's outline the componentry:

- **Set**, which is subject/object context, & **Setting**, which is time and place and situation. Creating a rich inner world is so so appealing these days.
- A **Narrator**, who tells the story, who can be unreliable, unknown, omniscient, a first-person character, a third-person observer, or the author.
- **Characters** with minds to project into, experiences to imagine, and feels to empathize with. Oh, and they need cool names. And back stories, personas, etc. Do I develop the characters as I write the story? Horse and cart must rumble sequential.
- **Plot**. The hero's journey. An arc. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement. Meet, wink, trigger, flirt, orgasm, cigarette, curtains. Again, shall I map the plot before I flesh it out? Likely an iterative process. Proceed with patience, compassion, and plain ol' passion.
- **Themes** or theme. These surely will develop on their own.
- Chapters, pages, lines, words, GO!
