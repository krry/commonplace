# Ascent of Mt. St. Helens

In 2009 I got a fateful call from Casey, a proverbial mountain of a man. He'd climbed many of the peaks of strategy that erupt from the game of Go, and now sought a rocky summit to trod with his legs. He was set on Mt. St. Helens, which no longer had a peak. We would reach the top, I intoned, channeling the hubris of everyman-child, and the pathos of a blissed-out Sisyphus.

In the previous months and weeks and nights of our effortless friendship we had explored what each of us was capable of, what we could describe, what we did not know, and what we could not do. We shared sloughs and troughs of IPAs among gloms of drunken trolls who bonded with grunts, mouthfarts and back-pounding hug replicas. We found ourselves dueling the spirits of ancient warriors and philosophers in vicarious deathmatches that left us unscathed and chortling over the heaps of ghostly casualties. We became good friends in this haze of salvaged reasoning and selvedge denim-clad mustacheos. Cascadia had chosen us for these moments, though we preferred to call in the State of Jefferson.
