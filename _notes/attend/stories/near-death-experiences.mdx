# Near Death Experiences - What Almost Killed Me

## A half-brown-painted wooden tee-ball bat

When I was six years old Ben Hecht hit me in the temple with a wooden baseball bat when I was placing the ball on the tee. He knocked me out, I woke up on the couch. My Mom had carried me there.

## A shoddily placed artificial rock climbing hold

When I was fourteen years old a climbing hold came off the wall as I was twenty-some feet off the deck, which was made of concrete. I slid down the wall and plummeted to the pavement. Time stopped. I rolled out of the fall and was not injured.

## A cornflake of stone 12' x 12' x 4"

When I was nineteen years old the face of a boulder flaked on me. Just as I reached the top of that fateful boulder, the whole front face—a piece of stone twelve feet tall by six feet wide by four inches thick—peeled away from the monolith I had nearly surmounted. I fell backwards onto the thankfully flat-ish boulder beneath, and the giant stony cornflake crashed upon me, shattering into pebbles and dust. Eva, my friend and spotter, smartly stepped out of the way, and let me fall. I was bruised all about the torso, lost my wind for a moment or two, but was otherwise unscathed. The fall though was a long one: I replayed my life, my relationships, my worth and lack thereof.

## Lack of heat, and lack of help

When I was twenty-five years old I awoke without hat or seeing-eye glasses on a patch of 10ºF neighborhood street in Champaign, Illinois. My friends were gone and my head was ringing from the backwards crack of my black icy slip thirty-five minutes prior. I had darted away from the pack on the short way back from our Jager fueled New Years celebration. Two blocks away from the pack I was lost and unstable. My right foot found a slippery patch just past the curb. My feet left the ground as I splashed back on to the street. I started out cold, dressed only in a thin, festive buttondown. I had foregone the luxury of outerwear for the four block stumble to and from Guido's—my former employer and now current watering hole—that night. I awoke by divine intervention and in wonderment. My hat was twenty feet behind me in an icy yard. The grass beneath the fallen, melted, refrozen snow had witnessed my near demise. The ground beneath the ice and snow had cracked my skull and the impact had bruised my fragile brain. I lolled left and lolled right, my limbs frigid with the cold of the half-hour I had spent unconscious on the ground. Something woke me, and I found my Sony Ericsson flipphone at three percent. The hard part of writing is leaving the description out. I looked for my glasses in the snow, a wire frame, tortoise-shell, but they were nowhere to be found in my desperate flounder for survival. I shivered, I convulsed. I cried out, "HELLO!" I heard only echoes: the tinnitus of my concussion and the crisp reverberation of my scream against the built bricks at this address.

3 A.M., New Years Day, 2008, Champaign, Illinois, a young man slips on ice when walking home from a party, and is found dead as fuck, frozen to bejeezes, a giant crapsicle.

## Misjudgment of momentum

When I was thirty-one years old I barely saved a skid on my motorcycle as I was bombing down a mountain highway at eighty-some miles an hour. There was gravel on the road, I brought too much speed into the curve, and I initially didn't lean into it. The tires washed, the bike and I brushed across the road into the opposing lane of the right hand downhill curve. I countersteered and regained control just as I reached the shoulder which bordered a cliff at least a thousand feet tall if not two or three. No guard rail stood between me and certain doom. I realized, as my thirty years were condensed into a single second, that I am the Kerry who survives. I will not be aware of the Kerries who die. My once-friend Nick witnessed this event.

## Lack of air

When I was thirty-three I nearly drowned in a hot tub while apnea training. This is a story I have lived, and written, and will convey once I've fully processed it.
