# Brain

We in the scientized West tend to confuse and conflate the brain with many other facets of our being.

If I am able to record a few examples, I think you will see what I mean.

## Brain as center

Lovevery, a lovely forward-thinking toy-maker, commits this folly in their marketing materials, essentially viewing the baby as a brain.

> Designed by experts for your baby's developing brain.
> The 10 best ways to grow your newborn baby's brain.

They are in earnest attempting to foster brain _activity_ development in newborn babies by providing parents with tools and techniques. But taking the baby as the brain, they miss their mark. And taking the brain as a physical organ to be built, rather than an antenna through which signals pass from within to without and vice versa. [[as-within-so-without]]
