# Nonlocality

### The Creative Process (The Do-Be-Do-Be-Do Process)
Dr. Amit Goswami
- Preparation - gather data, learn existing models
- Incubation - do nothing, quiet the conscious mind
- Imagination - allow waves of possibilities to flow over your mind
- Capture - seize upon new meaning from among the possibilities

A quantum leap is a discontinuous jump through the domain of possibility.

Quantum domains of reality: Manifestation and Possibility

An interaction between material entities cannot manifest a possibility. A non-material consciousness can manifest a possibility into actuality with a choice (or an intention).

John von Neumann's non-locality experiment that demonstrated a change in spin between entangled quantum particles at a rate faster than the speed of light supports the non-locality of consciousness.

In the quantum lexicon, consciousness observes and chooses. In our lexicon, it attends and intends. A conscious observer is required for possibility to manifest into actuality, for waves to collapse into a particle. [This is well-evidenced by the double-slit experiment wherein an observed photon behaves like a particle and chooses only one slit to pass through. An unobserved photon behaves like a wave and passes through either slit. An observer is necessary for a possibilities to actualize in manifest reality.](https://www.theepochtimes.com/prominent-scientist-says-consciousness-is-key-to-a-theory-of-everything_1647773.html)
