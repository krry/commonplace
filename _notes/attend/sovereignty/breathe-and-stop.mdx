# Breathe and Stop

I can't tell if you're smiling
with that mask up to your eyelids
but I find your scent beguiling
eau de terroir
or is that terror
pure and unbridled

anyone else feel put away wet
but don't remember getting
ridden hard
side or unsaddled?

I like my survivors
like I like my snakemeat
unrattled and well-molted

Those with whom we cohabitate
the I-and-I thrive mind
felt the weight of this crown
before it came crashing down
around our ears,
all our mortal fears
in a mushroom cloud of cosmic dust
and acid rainy days
seeded by sudden sovereignty

Carl the Fog gives sad hugs
I'm not sure that dude abides
social distancing
cuz he's all up in my grill again
another of those days that end in "Why
is it always hoodie weather?"
