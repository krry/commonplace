# Reality

All realities are virtual, and any can be the base reality depending on where a consciousness begins and how expansive its outward awareness becomes. Each reality can be defined and described independently from within by its inhabitants with their languages. Realities of which I am aware have dimensions, inhabitants, information transfer rulesets, and entropy. When we are conscious of more than one reality, we can start to build a common lexicon for describing realities as we compare and contrast their properties, attributes, qualities, characteristics, parameters, limitations, phenomena. Some pairs of realities may appear to form dichotomies when compared.

### Conscious mind vs. Unconscious mind

Around the turn of the 20th century, psychotherapists began to sort phenomena of the mind into the conscious and the unconscious. To Freud and his pupils, the conscious mind (_Bewusstein_) is home to the thoughts, feelings, memories, and desires of which we are aware at any given moment. In the unconscious mind (_Unbewusstein_) resides the (often unpleasant) thoughts, feelings, memories, and desires of which we are not presently aware. When a conscious being turns its attention inward, it witnesses certain thoughts, feelings, memories, and desires Jung's collective unconscious (_kollektives Unbewusstes_) underpins and surrounds the unconscious mind with instincts and archetypes like those Joseph Campbell expounded in _The Hero with A Thousand Faces_.

### Natural vs. Supernatural

Some experiences are difficult to share.

### Evident reality vs. Transcendent reality

### Domain of Manifestation vs. Domain of Possibility

From Westworld, Season 2, Episode 1:
Dolores: "What is real?"
Bernard: "That which is irreplaceable."

- TLDR:: What is experienced is real.
- Drawing from [[big-toe]]:
  - All potential realities can be real depending on the origin and perspective of the observer.
  - Inferred entities that are not directly measurable (like neutrinos and quarks) are relegated to non-physical reality, but indirectly measured/witnessed in the search for the causal relationships between measurable physical entities.
  - Concepts (like love, ego, justice, ethics, compassion, dark matter, and string theory) are inferred and defined into existence to support and maintain the consistency of our worldview.
    - This is not to say that they are real.
    - Mind, intuition, memory, and even consciousness may hover in this theoretical purgatory for many of us.
  - Beings, objects, and energy make up everything (all forces and entities) in a physical or a non-physical reality.
    - Beings possess [[sentience]]
      - aware of themselves and their environment, and able to make choices deliberately that impact themselves and perhaps others (from [[notes-on-my-big-toe]] p. 608)
