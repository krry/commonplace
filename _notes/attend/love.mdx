# Love

The answer to any open question.

The prime directive and origin of existence.

## Love Languages

Extended and adapted from Gary Chapman's 1995 book

- (receiving) gifts 👍🎂🎁
- (physical) touch 👆💆💆‍♂️
- words (of affirmation) 🖕🎭🥰
- (quality) time 💍👯👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- (acts of) service 🤙👷‍♀️👨‍🍳

What are the love languages for beings who have detached value from material existence and the judgments that arise within in?

- [[omotenashi]]
- effortless anticipation of needs to ease continued detachment and disillusionment. Embracing karuna (compassion)
- mudita, karuna, metta, upeksha and the [[brahmavihārās]]
- shared joy without interference or envy. Embracing brahmacharya (nonspoiling), compersion
- Autonomy
- unconditional support and acknowledgement of another's path of choice. Embracing asteya (nonstealing) and anatta (nonself)
- Nonreactivity
- [[mindfulness]] of the probability of tense circumstances that alleviates stress before it arises or bats it down before it grows. Embracing agaripraha (nongrasping)
- Forgiveness
- embracing anitya (nonlasting), allowing harm to pass and injury to heal

## Four Elements of Love

via Thich Nhat Hanh

1. Loving Kindness, metta, maitri, kindled within oneself with healing love, then offered as happiness to anyone.
2. Compassion, karuna, understanding suffering in self and other
3. Joy, mudita, offered as uplifting presence; vicarious, shared joy
4. Equanimity, uppekha, upeksha, anyone could be anyone to anyone, so we give everyone equal value, potential, possibility to love

"The roots of a lasting relationship are mindfulness, deep listening and loving speech, and a strong community to support you."
—Thich Nhat Hanh, _How to Love_

## From Roam

Love

- the primary force of creation
- the reason for being(s)
- the answer to any question, ultimately
- the opposite of fear and hate

### TLDR

- Love propels progress through evolution.
- The [[emotion]] you experience when you are aware of your nature and you realize your affinity for existence in any form.

### From Get Real [[May 12th, 2018]] or [[2018-05-12]]

- Love, like [[satchitananda]], seems to be absolute. Everything else is relative. When we consider non-being, love appears relative. Being is to non-being as love is to fear. But as we cannot conceptualize or model non-being. We often view love as absolute as being. The [[tao]] contains non-being as well, and as such:

  > ""The way you can go
  > isn't the real way.
  > The name you can say
  > isn't the real name."
  > — [[tao-te-ching]] §1
  > as interpreted by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]"

- Reality is a relational matrix of innumerable quanta, infinitesimal reality cells that can be in **this** state or **that** state, a 1-one or a 0-zero, yin or yang.
- Existence itself though is dimensionless, timeless, featureless: pure potential with unconditional love for itself, at once everything and no-thing, everywhere and nowhere.
- It is this limitless love, without beginning or end, origin or resolution, that brings us to be. #[[where-babies-come-from]]
- [[cnxns]] wants to know and enjoy itself, so it fashions itself a manifold of **facets**, each with a lens of experience to focus and the will to evolve and resolve ignorance.
- We tend to experience this will to resolve ignorance as curiosity. All life is curious, you will notice, unless deterred by fear, pain, and other threats of non-being.
- You, an awareness, are one of these **facets**.
- Love is the reason you are #NowHere.
- Love is one of two possible answers to a chain of "Why?"
- Why are you here reading this? If you did not answer with either Love or Fear, ask why again.
- Why do you want to know more about how we got here and what to do about it? Love or Fear
- Keep asking why. I think you will find that either love or fear is the foundational motivation for anything you attend or intend, and thus for every action you take and choice you make. #Sting
- As individuated, differentiated drops of [[cnxns]], the purest, simplest form of love we [[experience]] is [[affinity]] when we feel drawn to anything else.
- [[gravity]] is the manifestation of love as the [[affinity]] of [[matter]] for itself.
- Affinity draws together, converts energy from potential to movement, keeps us spinning and dancing, and pulls us into radiant union to warm our bones and shower us with the light of love.
- As a form of love, gravity is absolute but, applied to the relative aspects of [[reality]], it abides the [[the-speed-of-light]] and the [[quantum]] of change.
- Affinity, and thus gravity, grows stronger as we grow closer, as union becomes more likely.
- Love is not a choice.
- It is the force of absolute truth. It is felt.
- You cannot change what or whom you love, but you can pay attention and set intentions with the love you feel, or choose to ignore it and allow instead for fear to steer you.
- Love will guide you to create, to accept, to collude and commune, to collaborate and conspire.
- Fear on the contrary will help you rise against.
- With fear you can conquer and rule, you can take ownership rather than accepting responsibility, you can murder the track, or kill it on stage.
- Fear will help you act considerately, where you take the sides of others to predict their feelings while remaining separate from them. Considering requires no compassion, and is employed to avoid pain, not to generate and share joy. [[gurdjieff]]
- You will really stand out when you set yourself apart out of deeply rooted fear.
- You will be fearsome, and less loved, for fear begets fear as love breeds love, and each cancels the other as any pair of [[mutually-defining-opposites]].
