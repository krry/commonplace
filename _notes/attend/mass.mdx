# Mass

- Might it be that a supernova is the birth of a [[moon]], not the death of a star?
- Might it be that mass and [[cnxns]] closely or even directly correlate?
- Might it be that the [[moon]] feeds upon the souls of those who die on Earth?
- Might our wills be subsumed to that of the Earth serving us the Moon, and the Moon greedily devouring us?
