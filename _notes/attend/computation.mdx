# Computation

[Donald D. Hoffman claims](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00577/full) to have proven that consciousness cannot be identified with any functional properties of any computational system, disproving the reductive functionalist approach that would say "the mind is what the brain does".

What we perceive is akin to an interface symbolizing objective reality. We do not directly perceive the truth.

David Deutsch proposes Computation as one of the four fundamental principles of reality.
