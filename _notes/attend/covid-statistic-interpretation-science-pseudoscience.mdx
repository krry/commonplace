# COVID Statistic Interpretation, Science, Pseudoscience

I appreciate this admonition. Pseudoscience and science are easily conflated.

As we know, science requires no faith: just observation, hypothesis, experiment, evaluation, review.

We don't have to worry about who we can believe, or what their credentials are. We can listen to their premises and findings and decide whether it makes sense.

I am interested in understanding whether masks and social distancing and quarantine measures have been effective in preventing death from COVID (or death with COVID).

Ivor (whoever he may be) presents a sweeping analysis of this matter from many angles. I too doubt whether many of the figures and his interpretations are accurate or sound. 

His argument that a relative shortage of deaths in the season preceding the pandemic has inflated the excess deaths attributed to COVID seems plausible and falsifiable, which is a hallmark of scientific reasoning as Karl Popper would have it. We can look further at whether COVID is actually leading to more deaths than normal.

One could also interpret, as Ivor does, the results of Sweden's policies as supportive of the ineffectiveness of masks, social distancing, and quarantine. It would greatly improve the well-being of billions if that interpretation holds water. We can look further at that possibility without any danger.

I don't take these interpretations or arguments as conclusions, sureties, or dogma I can either believe or reject. They are possibilities that we can hold in ambiguity every time we slip our noses under the cubreboca to smell our mouths.

Whether poor Ivor has the accreditation we need to take his opinions and analyses wholesale as gospel, I think they point toward what will one day be more clear in hindsight: that this is a pandemic of fear, not of coronaviruses. That the culture of control that has us spraying for weeds, and bug bombing our houses, and, without exaggeration, strangling the biodiversity of the planet with a sweaty nitrile glove is losing its grip and throwing haymakers at straw men. Would a vaccine be freedom or another desperate stab at control? Your heart knows which.
