# Consciousness Vs. Self Consciousness

I'm seeing this duality more starkly than ever

| [[self-consciousness]]                      | [[cnxns]]                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Being terrified to be near each other       | Wanting everyone to be well      |
| Hiding our faces in shame                   | Smiling with our neighbors       |
| Spouting and spraying vitriol behind a mask | Sharing sacred silence and space |
