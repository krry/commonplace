# Fear

What causes fear?

I fear a threat or a danger, something that might harm me. The darkness sometimes scares me for it may hold something sinister. I evaluate these possible threats, these dangers, relative to how I identify myself. If I am my body, then things that may injure me or cause me disease are fearful. If I am my mind, thoughts that might threaten my sanity or my ability to perceive my environment are to be feared. If I am awareness, I fear what steals my attention away from the Truth, the self-deceptions or delusions that lead me to set intentions that isolate and separate me from what-is.
