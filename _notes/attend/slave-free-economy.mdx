# Slave-free Economy

A ridiculous ideal perhaps, but one worth pursuing all the same.
How might we behave in our daily lives so as to move toward a slave-free economy?

Might we start shipping many of our possessions to developing countries? Instead of our trash? Would this be different?

Might we stop purchasing items fabricated by [[free-will]]-less workers? Who would this hurt more?

Might we make our own goods? Could we?
