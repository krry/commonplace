Formerly we called this **Resources**, the third tier in the [[para-method]], these notes don't fit in one of my Projects or in my Areas of responsibility. I find it much warmer to view this is what made the grade, knowledge worth keeping, worth refining toward deeper understanding.

Pay no mind to those poor unfortunate notes stuffed in the [[forget]] box over there. Those used to be the **Archives**.
