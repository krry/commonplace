# Remember

These bits of knowledge have made the grade. They are worth keeping, worth remembering. Unlike those poor unfortunate notes stuffed in the [[forget]] box over there.

## The Basics

- [[books]]

## Some Gems

- [[first-principles-of-quantum-mobility]]

### 7 Stages

- [[7-crown]]
- [[6-third-eye]]
- [[5-throat]]
- [[4-heart]]
- [[3-navel]]
- [[2-sacrum]]
- [[1-root]]

Formerly we called this **Resources**, the third tier in the [[para-method]], these notes don't fit in one of my Projects or in my Areas of responsibility. I find it much warmer to view this is what made the grade, knowledge worth keeping, worth refining toward deeper understanding.
