# Sisyphus' Saga

- committed sins enough against the gods to be condemned to Tartarus
  - killed guests and travelers to his castle
  - seduced his niece out of revenge against his brother
  - outed Zeus for raping Aegina, daughter of Asopus
  - tricked Thanatos into his own handcuffs in Tartarus, leaving the dead to walk the earth for a while
  - colluded with his wife not to bury his body, give him a funeral feast, make sacrifices to Hades or Persephone, or place a coin under his tongue for passage over the river Styx so he could evade Hades and convince Persephone (Hades' wife) to let him out of the Underworld
    - Five rivers flow through/into Tarturus
      - Acheron (sorrow) - sad mother of Cocytus and Styx
      - Styx (hate) - pay Charon to cross and relieve your soul
      - Cocytus (lament) - drown your woes
      - Phlegethon (punish) - burn out your sins
      - Lethe (forget) - drink of the Lethe to forget and reincarnate
  - evaded the Gods until Hermes found him and threw him into Tartarus
  - condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain each day, only to have it roll back down when he reached the top
- He thwarted the cattle thief Autolycus
  - drew "SS" labels on the inside of their hooves, then seduced his daughter Anticleia
  - Anticleia later gave birth to Odysseus, probably Sisyphus' son, given his trickiness.
- Out of revenge against his brother Salmoneus, he raped his niece Tyro, who killed both of the children.
  - the Oracle at Delphi told Sisyphus that if he had a child with Salmoneus' daughter, that child would destroy his grandfather (Salmoneus)
  - Sisyphus raped his niece to bring this prophecy about
  - Tyro was the mother of Aeson, Amythaon, and Pheres
    - Aeson was the father of Jason (with the Argonauts and Golden Fleece)
    - Tyro also birthed Pelias and Neleus via Poseidon in disguise
    - Tyro killed her children from Sisyphus to save her husband Salmoneus
- He found out that Zeus had absconded with Aegina, daughter of Asopus.
- Given this knowledge, Sisyphus bargained with Asopus for an eternal fresh spring for Corinth.
- Asopus was the river god and the son of Poseidon.
- Betraying Zeus in re Aegina's capture led to his infamous curse.
