## 'suppose'

When did you start doing what you're "supposed" to?

"We're not supposed to."

Where does that take you? Nowhere? Childhood? The voice of a new buddy in the schoolyard? A neighborhood pal or a sibling in the backyard? Some strange child at summer camp? Your beau/boo/bae in backseat of a car?

It takes me back to the start of a lot of excellent adventures. Breaking free from supposition, denying the authority of those who suppose, doing what we're not supposed to: really edgy stuff, but almost always harmless.

So I've recently given up suppositionsâ€”mine and others'. Why suppose? How does it help you? Does supposing make you smile? Does it keep you safe, or just keep you locked in a box, wrapped up in *"sposta" al dente*?

I suppose you may be thinking this is ludicrous rhetoric, not tied to reality or morality, mere wordplay laden with normative rebellion. I tend to agree with you. 'Ludicrous' comes from the Latin *ludare* meaning 'to play'. 'Rhetoric' comes from *rhesis* meaning 'speech'. However wordplay needn't be disregarded on its very character.

Some philosophers posit that the whole universe is in a state of play, that it dances to the cosmic song. Spans of moments when we tune into that composition tend to be those when we are in flow (*a la* Czikszentmihalyi). Suppositions though are very good at derailing our flow; they lay under the tracks ruminating against our trajectories.

I am a young, able-bodied, educated, well-mannered American man. I am supposed to get a job, meet a nice woman, get married, buy a house, make a family, raise those kids until they are adults, then work until I retire, then retire until I expire. Sposta, sposta, sposta, sposta, sposta, sposta, sposta, sposta. Meh.

## 'expect'

"That's not what I expected you to say."

Here we go again. Where did that take you? Childhood again? Maybe this time heard the griping voice of someone younger than you.

Childhood, I wager. But those words didn't spring from your mouth. They were deeper set. They were set in a long standing culture of prediction. The future tense. The future perfect.

I posit that our expectations disserve us more than any mental constructs we engender.

## 'should'
