# All apologies. We are now subject to a megalofascist.

My mouth is agape. I feel awoken into a nightmare. I feel deeply sorry for what has come to pass. And yes, this too shall pass, but not for a few more years. My dear friend and colleague, Josh Dzielak, has written [a brilliant, heartfelt apology](https://medium.com/@dzello/my-apology-to-those-weve-failed-a2b1b157f8ca#.5fg7iif2x) which I strongly recommend you read before continuing here. As has often been the case, he has led me to open my eyes to the frightening truth, and has steeled my resolve to speak out in spite of my fright.

In the wake of yesterday's catastrophic election, I find myself filled with regret. My Dad has often said that we don't end up regretting what we have done, but rather what we have passed up or what we have failed to do. I have failed all of you. I have failed to convince you that you don't want a megalofascist regime in charge. I deeply regret this failure. This is a regret I will have to reconcile.

I use the term "megalofascist" because I agree with [Jordan Bates](http://www.refinethemind.com/12-best-arguments-against-trump/):

> To call this fascism doesn’t do justice to fascism. Fascism had, in some measure, an ideology and occasional coherence that Trump utterly lacks. But his movement is clearly fascistic in its demonization of foreigners, its hyping of a threat by a domestic minority (Muslims and Mexicans are the new Jews), its focus on a single supreme leader of what can only be called a cult, and its deep belief in violence and coercion in a democracy that has heretofore relied on debate and persuasion.

I'm at a loss for a more accurate term, because I don't think we've seen the likes of a Trump before, at least not in our young, fair, democratic republic. What is a fascist without principles poised with a tiny finger over the NUKE button? "You're fired!" What is a pseudo-rich, racist, misogynistic bigot who would say anything to change your mind? What is a power-hungry-hungry hippo with a gilded toupée who would counter-Oedipally impregnate his wives' daughters? As I said, I'm at a loss. Megalofascism is the nearest truth I can muster, not to name-call, or bully-back. We mustn't stoop to the chthonic depths of our soulless conquerors.

I've spent the last two days reading Hesiod and Homer, Virgil and Ovid, digging deep into the annals of history, mythology, and philosophy in search of a precedent for our terrifying new president, for our freshly rotten political ferment. Yesterday, or perhaps this year, we may have regressed back even further than the governors who piloted the Hellenes and Romans to glory then ruination. We may have elected a Pharaoh, a God-King who can do no wrong, one who speaks infallibly even when He contradicts Himself.

I have looked to Hadrian, Nero, Caligula, to the megalomaniacal emperors who drove Rome to its demise. I have combed the old ways for wisdom, for how they dealt with the rule of prior megalofacists. And I've come up dry, empty. God save us, even _if_ God is dead. Perhaps if God is dead we will invent a new one, as Voltaire once portended.

> Si Dieu n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer.

> "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."

## This is too little, too late.

I last voted in the year 2000, in the first year I was eligible to do so. That year the hanging chads eviscerated Gore and swept away the value I had placed in the suffrage my pale male brethren have so desperately strove to keep close to their chests. Yesterday I cast my only other votes. Hillary got my nod, I am ashamed to say. Jordan Bates and Sam Harris will help you understand that choosing the lesser of two evils was the necessary path yesterday. "A 'lesser of two evils' argument is valid if the greater of the evils is substantially more likely to cause a global catastrophe." We shot down condoms in porn, legalized marijuana, and somehow elected a flaxen-wigged demonspawn as the leader of the Free World. It won't be so free anymore, folks, sorry to be the harbinger on that one.

I have failed all of you by remaining quiet. I failed you by holding my tongue. I failed you by restraining myself. I am mortified by this failure. You deserve better. You deserve a leader with the intellect and charm of Barack, and a Congress with the resolve to drive meaningful progress. You deserve a governmental hug.

## What comes next may surprise you.

I will never give up. The love and acceptance of which I dream for the world's blossoming population of beautiful humans will come to be, or I will die trying to manifest it. The time to fight and close off has passed. We have no need for militaries anymore. We are nearly all instantaneously connectable and conscious of each other now. All human knowledge can be shared and accessed from nearly anywhere. Now is the time to draw together, to listen carefully, and to speak without violence, to let our cars drive themselves, to teach our computers to think for us, to teach our kids to lead us, to raise our hands and lift our spirits. Now is the time to be open, to feel, and to be felt. All successful living creatures have followed this guiding principle. We ought to fall in line, or we will fall instead.

In [_Before the Flood_](https://www.beforetheflood.com/), they observe that in a democracy our elected leaders must follow us. They must listen to our opinions and needs and respond to them well enough that we believe they support us. I concur, out of hope. This perspective lends us a glowing opportunity to lead by example, to steer the bull with a red velvet cape. Our time to lead is nigh, but we lie shrouded in the sins of our bigotted forefathers.

## Don't look back in anger

What's done is done. It is always as it would have been. We find ourselves at [the witch than which there is no witcher](http://www.radicalwords.xyz/blog/2014/5/19/the-which-than-which-there-is-no-whicher), to adapt Alan Watts.

The only choice we have is the very next one. And then the one after that. I choose peace, and love, and radical self-expression, and openness. I choose to listen attentively to those who offer authenticity, to those whose platform is inner truth, whose policy is unity. I hope, I pray, I believe you will join me. And I will no longer remain quiet. I will fail again and again, but not at this.
