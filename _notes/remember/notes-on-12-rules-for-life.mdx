# 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson

## Kerry's Cliff Notes

1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back.

   - "We (the sovereign _we_, the _we_ that has been around since the beginning of life) have lived in dominance hierarchy for a long, long time." At least 350 million years, if it began with lobsters.
   - Accept this, and the other burdens of Being: aging, merciless nature, disease, gravity, ignorance.
   - Maximize your position in the hierarchy by courageously fulfilling your potential.
   - Rise with the sun. Once you're up, eat a low-carb breakfast.
   - Natural selection: Nature is what selects _and_ what has been selected.
   - Stand your ground against tyranny. Speak your mind. Dare to be dangerous.
   - "If you _can_ bite, you generally don't _have to_."

2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping.

   - You are an inseparable, but utterly unique, part of the universe experiencing itself.
   - Only you can define your identity and well-being.
   - You are as worthy of well-being as any other part of the universe.
   - You are primarily responsible for your well-being; act like it.

3. Make friends with people who want the best for you.

   - Friendship is reciprocal; loyalty must be negotiated.
   - In friendships, eschew charity and pity.
   - Instead, seek co-commitment, cooperation, and mutual improvement.

4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.

   - Identify your abilities; reward yourself for using them well.
   - There is someone better at what you are doing. Ignore that fact.
   - Observe your actions to discover your true beliefs.
   - Your actions or your values could be failing to serve you.
   - "What could I do, that I would do, to make Life a little better?"

5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.

   - Employ encouragement, discipline, and punishment suitably.
   - Limit your rules and enforce them with minimal necessary force.
   - Kids learn to make friends by age four or they probably never do.
   - "Old age and treachery can always overcome youth and skill."
   - Parents (better in pairs) _must_ teach their kids to play nice.

6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

   - "When you're perfect, then worry about them," my Dad always says.
   - "Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong."
   - Find responsibility in yourself instead of fault with the world.

7. Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient).

   - Meaning springs up along the Way, when Order balances with Chaos.
   - Delay gratification: save and share to uphold the social contract.
   - Jung once wrote, "No tree can grow to Heaven unless its roots reach down to Hell."
   - Sacrifice fosters abundance; expedience depletes, leaving poverty.

8. Tell the truthâ€”or, at least, don't lie.

   - Stasis leaves you stiff and suffering.
   - The game is important. Any strategy that wins is valid.
   - Lies warp the structure of Being.
   - Learn/live/speak your truth; correct Being by Becoming.

9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't.

   - Listen like they know something you don't.
   - If you care, don't give or take advice.
   - The purpose of memory is to guide our future, not recall our past.
   - Thinking is listening to an internal debate. It is easier aloud.
   - In a discussion, first sum up what was just said until they agree you understand. Then offer your perspective.
   - Most conversations concern dominance, not listening/understanding.
   - Lecturers: talk to individuals in the group, cycling among them.
   - Mutual exploration embracing ignorance is active philosophy.

10. Be precise in your speech.

    - Determine who you are, what you need, and what you want. Then articulate these to others, iterating until they are clear and understood.
    - "We perceive a very narrow slice of a causally interconnected matrix" which consists mostly of possibilities and uncertainties.
    - Precision specifies reality.

11. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.

    - Pursuing the greater good does not involve controlling others.
    - Boys won't/can't/don't engage girls in true competition because it isn't clear how they could ever win.
    - A controlling Oedipal/Terrible Mother keeps her children weak to maintain co-dependence.
    - Status-wise, women tend to marry up, while men tend to marry down. Men must grow accustomed to being the stronger partner.
    - Pursuit of a collective goal creates meaning and a hierarchy among the pursuers according to their individual performances and outcomes.
    - "Group identity can be fractionated right down to the level of the individual." Essentially there is no fair or true way to classify human beings.
    - Men forced to feminize are more drawn to fascist ideology.

12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.
    - We form and participate in groups to give ourselves microcosms of the dominance hierarchy in which we can succeed.
    - Being (mortal) requires limitation.
    - Noticing supersedes thinking (or imagining).
    - Handle an ongoing crisis by scheduling some time each day to confront it, and otherwise ignoring it.
    - Matthew 6:34 reads, "Sufficient to the day are the evils thereof." We don't need to search for more distant problems to solve.

## Other notes

### Beware the Evil triad: arrogance, deceit, and resentment.

- Arrogance arises when we forget that we don't know anything. Choose ignorance over arrogance.
- Deceit sneaks in when we fear to speak the truth. It compounds like interest.
- Resentment emerges when your needs aren't voiced or met. Either you are being taken advantage of or refusing to adopt responsibility.

### Chaos + Order = Existence

- The taijitu, the symbol representing the monist and dualist aspects of reality, is commonly depicted as a circle divided into yin and yang, Chaos and Order, which interpenetrate.
- Chaos is _yin_, _hrim_, origin, matter, femininity, possibility, ignorance, freedom, swirls in the right brain.
- Order is _yang_, _om_, ambition, spirit, masculinity, manifestation, knowledge, structure, generated in the left brain.
- The Way (the Tao) lies along the wandering knife's edge, the dotted line of risks and chances, between Order and Chaos, yang and yin.
- A six-pointed star is constructed with an upward triangle symbolizing Shiva, _om_, the masculine, and a downward triangle, Shakti, _hrim_, the feminine. The four elements (air, fire, earth, water) are represented as subsets of the star.

### Perception of reality

- First we observe our relationships with the universe: "Here I stand."
- Then we perceive meaning: "I could sit there."
- Then we construct objects to play the roles in those observed relationships that hold meaning: "That is a chair."
- Objective reality is the set of constructs the meaning of which we tend to agree upon.

### Game theory of life

- "If something can be done at all, it can be done better or worse. To do anything at all is to play a game with a defined and valued end, which can always be reached more or less efficiently and elegantly."
- Comparison may be the thief/death of joy, but meaning requires the difference between better and worse.
- There are many games to play. Choose ones that match your talents, or invent new ones.
- Winning at everything may mean you are not doing anything new or difficult, not growing. Growing may be the most important form of winning.
