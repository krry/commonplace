# Longevity

Is living longer better?

[Elon Musk has said](http://summit.vanityfair.com/videos/the-new-establishment-summit-elon-musk-does-not-want-to-live-forever) we should aim to live better while we're here. That he doesn't want to live forever.

I like the idea of living for a few lifetimes. Two? Three? Or _n_ lifetimes? I'd want them grouped, cordoned off. Reincarnation is **very** appealing. A string of discrete lives in which we can learn from the last if we wish but also willfully reset our situations: this is my heaven.

Now marks the first moment in time in which I have realized this. "In which"? A phrase

It's not that I would want them grouped or cordoned. I do want them that way. I don't think I can choose, not at this point. Violetta disagrees. She would say that we can choose, that we can express lofty opinions that and manifest them around us.

This notion is very difficult to contradict. My training as a lawyer has helped me understand that this notion is free from the strictures of logic. You can dance, you can live forever, you can do anything you haven't already done. That is the power of 'can'.

Will you?
