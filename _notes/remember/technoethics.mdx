# Technoethics - there's a shitcloud coming

## Origins

The term **'technoethics'** was apparently coined by Mario Bunge in [a 1977 paper in _The Monist_ (Mario Bunge, The Monist, Vol. 60, No. 1, Bioethics and Social Responsibility (JANUARY, 1977), pp. 96-107)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27902461). He posited that the technologist is personally responsible to all of mankind, unlike others whose responsibility extended to closer knit sets of associates. Further, the technologist, he poses, "has the duty to face, ponder over, and solve his own moral problems... [and] is singular privileged to do so" with the help of technology of her invention. I don't deny Bunge's hypothesis.

## New shit has come to light!

In my brief lifetime, I've witnessed the start of an enormous techno-cultural shift. When I was born, knowledge was difficult to obtain. It started in our modern equivalents of monks (or the priest class), and made its way down well-worn paths to budding minds in schools, libraries, and universities. Knowledge was locked away in books, authored, edited, published, bar-coded, and sold as a commodity. Empires were built on guarded, secret knowledge (e.g., Coca-Cola, and the Bush administration). Information was scarce, and the knowledge is carried was coveted. Knowledge was power. Somewhere around the year 2000, this began to change, and it finished changing rather quickly. Did you notice?

You may not have noticed (in fact I hope you haven't, as this essay will be more interesting), but information is no longer scarce. In fact the rise of the Internet has swiftly turned an information famine into an information feast. It was @mandhillon that first alerted me to this recent info-economic u-turn. This notion has changed the way I looked at everything: politics, economics, science, transportation, communication...

Before we jump in the deep end, allow me an expository digression. Haha, long words. When I refer to 'information' I'm adapting the definition from James Glieck's _The Information_. Loosely speaking, information is the medium of meaning, and the inverse of entropy. Meaning is a quantum of possible change. And knowledge is valuable meaning. Knowledge often passes to us as information. That might seem a rather glib treatment of some weighty concepts, but bear with me. _This too shall pass._

Back to the lecture at hand.
