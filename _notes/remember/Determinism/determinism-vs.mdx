# Determinism vs. Teleonomy

## *Teleonomy*
- the quality of apparent purposefulness and of goal-directedness of structures and functions in living organisms brought about by natural laws (like natural selection)
- τέλος telos ("end, purpose") and
- νόμος nomos ("law"), and
- means "end-directed"
- contrasted with *teleology*, which is the use of the language of goal-directedness in accounts of evolutionary adaptation
	- end law vs. end word

## Determinism
