# Maslow missed a step

Take it from anyone who self-actualized at a young age and then regressed like I have: Maslow missed a few steps, namely the higher-order ones. Once you self-actualize, greater issues become germane: societal, religious, ethico-moral, genetic, special, environmental, solar, galactic. These are extensions of Maslow's hierarchy which many of you have likely found to be obvious. The hierarchy is not a pyramid, nor does it have a ceiling or a last rung.

Rupert Spira, no Alfred Bester, no something Kinder, no Ken Kesey, no Ken Wilber, that's it, contrasts (usefully I think) [[growing-up-vs-waking-up]]. Sam Harris seems to play on this and morning time for the title of his podcast, etc.: "Waking Up"

# Maslow missed a few tiers

When I consider my own wants and needs—which to fulfill first, which to eschew or delay—I often end up attempting to stack them in a list or hierarchy _a la_ Maslow.

> Do I want food or companionship? Do I want love or esteem? Do I want water or shelter? Self-knowledge or belonging?

A lot has changed since 1954 when [Motivation and Personality](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation_and_Personality_(book)>) was published. We weathered a Cold War. Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam each held the unwelcome spotlight of the military-industrial complex. We cast a host of new villain states: Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Al Qaeda, ISIS, the Bush Administration. Greed and selfish desire became the winning strategy after liberalism had vanquished socialism as well as Nazism. Patriotism and nationalism fell away as corporate personhood rose to prominence. Capitalist advertising ousted nationalist propaganda. Before long even huge, multinational organizations had selves to know, and certainly selves to serve. A person can take many forms these days. Our personal needs have evolved and diversified accordingly.

Since 1954, we have endeavored to make all of our knowledge instantly accessible to anyone, expanding and refining the knowledge bases as we have networked them with terminals and access points in our offices, homes, schools, and pockets. We have enabled any person to maintain a global presence, and to communicate with any other willing sentient being. We began to encode the work to which we devote ourselves into algorithms that computers and robots can complete with infinitely higher accuracy, precision, and consistency. We have started to crumble the imaginary walls within the corpus of humanity that divide us into races, genders, ages, religions, and political parties. Lots of progress: really big stuff!

In light of all we've built and been through since we became aware of Maslow's hierarchy, I'd like to ask three questions. Does this one-dimensional hierarchy guide us to thrive, or merely survive? How could we tune it toward thrival? Is a need for self-actualization still the pinnacle of personal development?
