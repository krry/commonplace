## Stop fighting about energy

Experimentation plays a pivotal role in technological advancement. Unfortunately this applies to war tech as well. They have to test it to see if it works.

Who do they test it on? Why do we need better war machines?

## Why to fight for recognition of the Sun

The solar aesthetic is transparent.

The sun will shine through us, or we can absorb its rays.

and its embrace is everything and inevitable.
