# The First Song

This weekend I got to thinking about melodies and their origins. It is hard to find a song that isn't derivative from another song. It's hard to find, or make, an original melody these days. We're swimming in earlier melodies, recorded or recounted, remixed, replayed. But where did they come from?

I'll posit two sources: the birds, and our eukaryotes.

The birds descend from the dinosaurs, from the last great animalian empire, one which lasted hundreds of millions of years longer than the "reign" of humanity upon these fertile soils. Perhaps the songs of birds even date back to the Jurassic era. Perhaps they won't let us forget. Perhaps we couldn't write a melody without their input.

I can't claim to have listened to enough birdsongs to support this hypothesis. But it seems irrefutable to me, ignorant as I may be. Take the complete set of bird melodies sung throughout time, cross-reference them with human melodies. I doubt you'll find any uniquely human melodies. Even among our songs it's easy to find repetition and parallels. See Robin Thicke's debacle in our fair Copyright courts. Review the assertions of Marvin Gaye's estate. There's nothing new under the sun, folks, just remixes of older vibes.

If you're with me, then, did the birds write all of our songs? Are we just picking them up here and there? If not the birds, then who wrote them? Who sang the first song?

Perhaps our single-celled ancestors did. "Buzz buzz, buzz buzz, mmmbop." Would it be so bad to acknowledge that we've drawn uncredited inspiration from our ancestors since our advent?

I'm asking a lot of questions, mostly rhetorical, for which I don't have answers. I'm challenging the commonly held belief that there is a distinction between human and animal, between human and "lesser" life. I'm okay with us as balder primates. I'm fine with great-great-grandma orangutan. And with Mozart recording the birds on his harpsichord.

For millennia the birds may have scratched their messages into trees as they sang them. And recently we have plucked their feathers and dipped quills in ink to classify and record birds' notes. We weren't wrong to do so, perhaps barbaric, performing a thoughtless tribute.

But the birds learned their songs from someone, or something, animal, human, or otherwise: turtles' squeaks, frogs' croaks, whales' bellows. And their age-old songs have found our ears since we've had ears growing. Who are we to deny our elders' talents or wisdom?

# Older vibes

When the first proteins formed in a paleolithic cess pool, I imagine they danced together, to some beat, some melody.
