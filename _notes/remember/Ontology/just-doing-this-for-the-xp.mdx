# The simulation is real

Recently I've been examining my motivations, looking for the carrots and sticks, the greeds and fears, that move me. And I've been exploring my fear of death and the swirling illusion of reality, as one will always have done.

There may be a path along which I spend too much time pondering such mysteries, and there is certainly a path along which I spend too little time seeking to understand my existence. I'll not follow either of those.

The two realizations I have come to **that I would like you to share** seem simple now; they have dissolved into the water table that nourishes my mortal loam. And they both fit comfortably into the existential model of reality as a simulation [*a la* Nick Bostrom](http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html) that Elon Musk has recently popularized. If we could someday simulate reality, and don't self-destruct, it's likely that will we spread and colonize and self-replicate into real and virtual spaces until we run out of real permutations and start iterating on past and future perfect possibilities. If we do exist, then we exist in one of these zillions of simulations or in the one base reality. Hence it is likely that this is a simulation. And the simulation is real, as real as it gets for now.

Everything goes a bit topsy-turvy when you accept the simulation. Are other people simulated, or real and inhabiting the same simulation as me? Is truth possible? Am I hungry? Will I ever find love? Am I in debt? When does the next simulation start? Do I have to earn my place in it? Does anyone deserve anything? What are the operating principles of base reality? What is there to be scared of, and is fear really a motivator for someone who accepts the simulation?

> I am doing this for the XP.
	I am the one who survives.
	No one ever really lives.
	No one I know has died.

## Barring death, what do you deeply fear?

[Death is a silly thing to be scared of, but there are worthwhile fears.](https://itun.es/us/YldXw.l) I am scared of the dark. This is one of the last fears I maintain. The dark may hold unknown hazards or dangers for which I am unprepared. I may be caught off-guard by some agent of the darkness. The light cannot hold these dangers, so the dark holds my fear.

I have been advised that I could spend my waking hours blindfolded until my fear of darkness becomes diluted by a wealth of safe, positive experiences in darkness. I may try this someday when my daily livelihood does not require sightedness, or when I can at least spare a few blind hours a day.

Demystifying or uncovering the root of a fear makes that fear much easier to confront. For example I recently found myself feeling jealous of my lover's interactions with others. I did not like this feeling, so I asked myself from where it arose. I found the root of this jealousy planted in a soil of mixed fears: fear of inadequacy, fear of exclusion, fear of abandonment, among others.

My fear of abandonment comes from an obvious place. Being abandoned by the one I love the most would leave me, at least in the short term, vulnerable, uncertain, and less able to survive and thrive. Fear of abandonment is legitimate for the same reason that companionship is a valuable.

Being excluded or left out can be a competitive disadvantage in any market. Our society is built of organizations of people that agree upon certain stories and then talk about each other within and without those organizations. The boundaries and memberships of the organizations greatly determine each one's access to resources, and access to resources tends to again have great influence on one's survival and thrival. This is a legitimate fear especially because recovery from exclusion can be difficult. Once you're out, you're out! The chance of exclusion is prudent to monitor from any organizations that offer you access to unique or imperative resources.

Inadequacy may be an incurable condition, thus it is scary. Certain situations give me the nagging suspicion that I could have been a better version of me at that moment had I chosen differently in moments past. It is in these situations that the fear of inadequacy arises. I am helpless to change any of these choices in moments past, and am now hopelessly at the mercy of their impact on my character, behavior, and constitution. A mild fear of inadequacy may be the best and only medicine against it. If I am blissfully unaware that I am not adequate, am I truly blissful?

So then, on to the big kahuna: death. Death is unknown. We do not know its impact, its value. We have no accounts of the sensations of death, or of the experience of death. No one who has died has told us what it is like. You have never died. I have never died. And yet we fear it?

What detriment does death represent? What might it deprive you of? Similarly what might you stand to gain from death? What unknowable freedom or paranormal glory might death bring? From whence springs our fear? Uncertainty, I'd guess, the unknown, the same dirt at the root of my fear of the dark. However in the case of death, it may hold dangers or hazards, but I have no way of evaluating them in comparison to the hazards and dangers I encounter in life. The light is safer than the dark, but life is not verifiably safer or more pleasant than death.

I don't have the answers, only the questions. Because I lack answers to the inquiries that can establish the value or purpose of a fear of death, I am faced with a simple conclusion. I cannot fear death. This fear is not useful. I do not fear death, I merely avoid it pretty well.

## You are the one who survives.

Tails you're it, but on the heads side of this coin, I think you'll find an analogous realization. If no one of us here can describe the experience of death, or can prove to have died and lived to tell the tale, then we are all alive. As certain as you may like to be about the dead-or-alive status of someone or something else, you can be absolutely certain that you are the one who survives.

If every choice you make irreparably influences the moments that follow the choice, then every choice represents the opportunity to become one self or another, to inhabit one reality or another. Mapping out these possible realities, these possible selves, gets complex quickly. In the next moment you could make a thousand choices that might end your life, a thousand that might save it, and a million others that have some lesser effect.

## The simulation is real

Simulation or not, we agree that people die here who don't breath here.
So unarmed as I am (not) with a fear of death, and confident that I am the one who survives, could I put this to the test? Can I choose to stop breathing?

I have held my breath as long as I can stand, but I end up gasping or sputtering eventually. I have meditated underwater for minutes at a time, long enough and foolishly enough to pass out and breath water instead, but it didn't stop me breathing.  I am not sure I, or anyone here, could opt out of breathing. Nor would I recommend experimenting with this, but science will require us to eventually.

This simulation, or this reality, has certain rules we've agreed to, and certain interface limitations. We travel forward in time at a constant rate, never back, and never faster or slower than anyone else. Two bits of matter cannot occupy the same space. Two consciousnesses cannot occupy the same body, identity, persona, mind. I think therefore I am, and the Turing test goes deeper when turned within.

Then what sense can we make of our senses? Am I real? Can I define myself with the experiential structure of others here?

I read that our existence here is defined and describable by [thirty or more distinct sensations we experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense?wprov=sfsi1):

* light
* sound
* contact
* scent
* flavor
* pressure
* itches
* heat (thermoception)
* pain (nociception)
* thirst
* hunger
* direction (magnetoreception)
* time passing (chronoception)
* vibration (mechanoreception)
* proprioception (proximity of the body to itself and other objects)
* equilibrioception (balance and acceleration)
* muscle tension
* breathiness (pulmonary fullness)
* gasiness (gastrointestinal fullness)
* gagging
* nausea
* the urge to urinate or defecate
* vasodilation (headache, blushing, etc.)
* cardioception, and
* excesses or lacks of
	* oxygen
	* carbon dioxide
	* salt, and
	* sugar.

Beyond our senses, we share types of perception such as our circadian rhythms, ultradian interval timing, agency (free will and choice), and familiarity (notably separate from recollection).

When we discover the rules, the methods of our API with the simulation, and we understand our fears, we can proceed to a fascinating vantage.

## Without a fear of death, how does the one who survives carry on?

If this is a simulationâ€¦

Let me begin again.

Imagine a world where we conscious few harness our surroundings in such a way so as to become able to create implied orders, agreed-upon fictions, that gather us together into gossipy pockets as Harari has not precisely cast them but might nod to. Imagine a world where your perception could be a simulation of the reality you aspire to believe and enrich. This may be much like where you find yourself right now.

### If this is a simulation, who else is real?

Imagine a world where we can create alternate realities, virtual ones that mirror imperceptibly our base reality. Let one hundred years pass. Let the minds around you who enjoy these alternate realities pour themselves, all their creativity and productive energy into making them realer and more fulfilling. Then give them children (of mind or body) who pursue this mission with the same or amplified fervor, but with their own needs for root-level fulfillment. Let this pattern run for a generation or two or three or fifty. Will these new, enlightened ones introduce their offspring to base reality? Or will they skip some steps and start them with the latest update?

## Do we start our young at square one?

We don't, not here. Add a rule to the book.

Beer gives you a belly. Check.
Murder is not sometimes okay when other people find out about it. Check.
Suicide is painless. Guacamole is extra. Cats are cute and your dog loves you. Check and check and check check.

To start totally over with a young one would seem ludicrous to anyone well settled and indoctrinate to the rules here.

Are you feeling like a young one? I am. This probability is new to me, so I'm grasping at straws and coming up short in my effort to re-normalize.

## The hard questions

1. If the reality I know is a simulation, am I the only one experiencing it?
2. If yes, how do I treat the others here? What will come of that?
3. If no, who is also "real" and how do I tell?
4. If no, am I in any way different from the others I encounter? Wouldn't we all be simulations?
5. If yes, how can I help? Can I help? How can I help? Is anything wrong? Is there a goal?
6. Are goals???
7. Optimistic nihilism?
