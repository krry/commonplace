# Is this hell?

"Life is suffering." A Buddhist may have said this in so many words but another tongue. Anyone else might have uttered or iterated it, likely has, likely without ideological dogma. This is a thought likely to occur when you're deep in the pocket, when you've given up all the ghosts and you're onto that new new.

It certainly isn't heaven here. But why couldn't this be hell? The markers are present. The color of my credit card sets people off. Couldn't be heaven. Why do I have a Chase Ruby card? I don't know. Moxy?

The simulation is realer than ever and the hardest part is figuring out who else is real and trapped here. It's easy to cast this plane as the hell our preachers once pounded the pulpit about. Nothing is "right", not objectively, so this can't be heaven. I live in a pool of temptations and heathen. They are neighbors and friends and they seem normal af but once I get to know them it becomes unexpectedly clear. Heathen indeed and heathen I love but heathen all the same.

There is liberation in hell. And wonder. Would hell ever tell you where you are? Wouldn't it be more punishing to let that be a mystery?

On the flipside of the same token, if this is hell, then the only way to go is up, figuratively. And these souls around me might be just as condemned and yet unaware of their plight.

Living in hell would give me a very singular goal: get the fuck out of hell. I could think of nothing else. Have I been here the whole time? Is this another day in a consciousness without a past but painted with memories meant to lend plausibility? Are my dreams as real as my awake state?

The freedom to ask these questions isn't given to anyone. Humans have no rights. Money ain't a thang. No one deserves anything. Take your time and chew. This is a simulation, there are rules, and rules worth breaking. There exists a great divide between you and your comeuppance, and between my and mine. There is no hurry in hell, so what's the rush? What's the rush anyway?

I'm reluctant to divulge the way it could be. What if I fuck it up for you and for me by acknowledging and publishing the clandestine way it is? It doesn't get unposted. Bostrom was immensely brave to offer his Simulation Argument.
