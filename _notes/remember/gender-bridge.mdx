# A Bridge for the Gender Gap

The gap is a disparate fear of death. Women have historically wed with older men, and raised their children only to eventually mourn their fallen suitors. Why?

Because those who bear our children fear death more than those who inseminate our bearers. And rightly so: there are less bearers than seeders, and without enough bearers our species is lost. A million virile young seedful warriors and one maiden womb cannot birth an empire. Whereas a million fertile vessels and one mighty, tender fountain of seed might an empire build. The odds are stacked against the necessity of a single seeder's survival when we are concerned with the reproductive health of the human (the only) race.

There are legions of gorgeous flowering plants who have evolved aromatic potions and spells to entrance hives and hordes of boyish bees to wing their botanical sex cells together.

> Taste my beauty, you winged minion. Bathe in my appeal. Coat your furry fuselage in my pollen. Bow your hive mind to my ancient will. Buzz off to my distant cousins. Crop-dust them with the good news that I am well and thriving.

## Perhaps we can learn from our flora

Can you pick a female cherry tree from a male cherry tree? These organisms have been muddling through questions of sexuality and gender for millennia more than you and I. Those that bloom among us and afar from us have come to balanced resolutions to which we could aspire. Are you a pistil or a stamen, a deliciously fruity ovary or the bitterly imperative seed it protects and conveys? An oovum awaits a sperm, we're told, as a sperm seeks an open egg.
