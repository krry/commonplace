# Walking the path without knowing the path

There's some clever concoction of Heisenberg's uncertainty, Einstein's relativity, Thoreau's civil disobedience and Gandhi's nonviolent resistance, and a dog's stepwise trot between piss smells along a familiar walk that a wiser man could distill into a tincture of enlightenment on this matter. But I am more like a hound with a nose for acridity than a wizard of particle physics and inner peace. So perhaps I'll start there.

Few if any of us know our paths until we can crane our necks back along where we have trod. More may claim secret, certain knowledge of where the 'X's lie; pigs seeking their truffles. Many more still will assert that their "ex-"s lied; they are lost along the way with feathers ruffled. But all these destinations lie under shadow, fog, or ground. The burial plots of our treasured destinies—our fate-filled graves—rest unmarked in peace.

That makes me a trusty truffle hound of sorts. Long have I followed my myopic nose into dark corners of dank woods. I divine from treat to treat, with my beacon, my guiding light and my aegis, aloft between the trees. A five-year plan: too remote for orienteering, too distant to target, but in sight and in mind.

Any sailor worth his salt before plotting a course, will ask for a pin drop, a flag, or a star. Strong winds prevail from near shores too far. A compass points up wherever you are. An astrolabe ties treasure maps to the skies. But no instrument, gadget, or rickety ratchet can guide us through storms or batten the hatches. Ask Magellan or Cabot what swept them to safety: was it science or maths, or blind luck and patience?
