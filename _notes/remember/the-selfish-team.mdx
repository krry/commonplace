# The Selfish Team

## The tale of a _gene_ and a _meme_

Once there was a _gene_.
Wave to the crowd, Gene.

And then there was **Meme**.
Say "Hey", Meme.

Gene did not know Mimi. (She went by 'Mimi', though no one knew why. Her name had been 'Meme' for, well, since the beginning of it all.)

Anyway, Mimi knew when people liked her. Always had. It was kind of her thing.

Gene led a solitary life. His breakfasts were swift, on to work. Gene's job was _very_ intensive.

Gene's boss was rarely around. In fact, Gene hadn't ever met his boss. Supposedly he was a real stickler. But Gene had only ever seen a memo or two with his name on it.

Mimi on the other hand knew Gene's boss very well. She certainly had his ear these days. Gene's boss couldn't get Mimi out of his head. Which seemed absurd to Gene, whose professional advances had yielded no responses whatsoever.
