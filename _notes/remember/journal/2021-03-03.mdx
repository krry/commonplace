- Another minor release for #Nameless last night

    - is it time to try to make it marketable?
    - considered offering an interactive experience for meditators to set intentions and reflect upon situations

        - Headspace?
        - Calm?
    - Does no one else want what I want?

- Gave #[[Zephyr Bear]] a dream feed bottle at 11 pm

    - This was a battle

    - He wakes up in his swaddle constantly

    - In the middle of the night he woke up and shat as hard as he could, seemingly to escape the swaddle

    - This morning I lay awake and dozy with him on my chest and still he flails and chatters but not as frustratedly and I can comfort him easily

- #Gratitude
    - Babies, mainly for babies
    - Second chances
    - and thirds and so on
    - Whatever chance we're on
    - we are forgiven
    - that's where the gift has already arrived
    - you are the gift
    - I am the gift
    - babies once
    - and now lost most likely
    - but not for long
    - since babies once
    - again can bring us 'round
