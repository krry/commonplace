- Today I finished the two segment design interview with [[CodeSee]]. - they paid me $500 for 8 hours of work, which is a bit under my rate, but a paid interview is a lovely perk
  I tried to deliver them usable work product in return
- I reached out to [Russell Cottrell](http://russellcottrell.com/) today, offering [[nameless]], offering my help in whatever capacity.
- [[zephyr-bear]] is in a swaddle. He shows more awareness all the time, doesn't want his arms tied down, and won't let Elysa sleep otherwise. We are in a tight spot trying to treat him well and ourselves well. Maximum compassion all around!
