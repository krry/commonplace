# Journal Entry 2021-02-19

- Today I'm #babywearing [[Zephyr Bear]] in a Moby
    - previously I have used a Boppy
    - we also have an ErgoBaby
    - so far I like the simplicity and comfort of the Moby the best
    - the Boppy is consistent and reliable, stays in place
    - the ErgoBaby needs a newborn insert to fit our little one
- Today I'm architecting [[BabySteps]]
    - will be hosted at [ZephyrBear.name](https://zephyrbear.name) initially
    - intended to be an integrated, online:
        - shareable family baby book
        - development milestone timeline/tracker/teacher
        - product finder? advice gatherer?
    - features in the MVP
        - mobile first
        - main timeline view
        - milestone info and tracking
        - family passwordless authentication?
        - photo uploads? import photos from Google, Family Album app, Apple?
