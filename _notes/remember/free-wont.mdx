# Free Won't

How did we get here?
Is it my fault?
What does it all mean?
Are we just lost?

Kanye's my dog yo.
You could be too.
Drop the free will thing
You don't have a choice

Readiness potential
Your brain knows before you what you're gonna choose, which is such a relief if you're sweating the guilt
