# The Way of Zen

by Alan Watts

# Thoughts while reading

## Subjectivity

The common condition of every awareness is the experience of reality from a uniquely subjective perspective. Each of us is because we have these unique subjective perspectives and vice versa. It is our raison d'etre.

Contrarily, as William James put it, "we are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep." Because we each represent a bud at the tip of a branch stemming from many larger branches to limbs off the trunk of a single father tree rooted in mother earth, intermingling, interacting, and interpenetrating a multitude of other buds, we innately feel our connectedness and crave to convert or translate our unique subjective perspectives into something shared, something agreeable. So we construct abstractions to describe our subjective experiences: language, art, maths.

"You do not know where your decisions come from, they pop up like hiccoughs."

## Buddhism

_Mahayana_ means great vehicle
It refers to the earlier Pali Canon as _hinayana_, little vehicle.
_Upaya_ are methods of attainment of liberation.
_Nirvana_ or _moksha_ are the liberation from self, attachment, suffering, frustration (all _dukkha_).
Medieval Indian _tantra_ involves the repetition of _mantra_ (spiritual words and formulae called _dharani_ and yoga directed toward sexual intercourse with a _shakti_ or spiritual wife.

Buddha likely intended his "_upaya_, a skillful means of enabling one to realize, concretely and vividly, the absurd vicious circle of desiring not to desire, or of trying to get rid of selfishness by oneself."

_Bhakti_ is the devotion a Bodhisattva may focus upon having attained enlightenment and refused nirvana to instead remain and share his insight with others.
