# Technology should be magical

The most highly adopted technologies:

1. perform a useful function by
   a. improving upon and substituting for an old solution
   b. solving a new or unsolved problem
2. without requiring additional effort or understanding from users

Good technology appears to be magical Tesla, Disney.
To really engross a user, it's necessary to have two qualities:

1. seems to work by magic
2. stays behind the curtain (like the Wizard of Oz)

## For example, introducing:

## The easiest content uploader/generator

### Drop anything on the huge central dropbox

- links - we'll parse it for images or media, and record the attribution data
- images - we'll clean up the metadata
- folders - drop as much as you like, we'll call you when it's done

### Hint at images of anything

- we'll find properly sized jpgs and pngs
- we'll build you custom animated gifs from them
- we can find similar (hopefully better) versions of the images

## The Magic Post Box

Drop anything here:

- links
- images or a gif
- folders offer an array of results
- more like this

Or give us:

- hints
- words
- other images
