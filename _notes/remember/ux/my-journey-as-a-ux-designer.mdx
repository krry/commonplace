# The Spectrum of UX

## Back in 2009â€¦
The Information Architects, who shall remain nameless and faceless unless you [Google them](google.com/iA), have put together [a lovely illustration of the spectrum of user experience](http://iA.com/uxpectrum).  Five years later, UX <strike>hasn't</strike> has changed a bit.  The 'U' doesn't stand for 'user' anymore, for example.  And you can't just heave a catapult-full of buzzwords at a rainbow-colored, ternary Venn diagram to explain the growing complexity that is UX.  The pretty colors will only distract discerning learners for so long.

These days [Photoshop is a beached whale carcass](deadwhale.jpg): so bloated with the rotten ghosts of legacy use cases, it may burst your buffer and panic your Colonel. And while I enjoyed my days/weeks/months building static interfaces out of nicely named/grouped layers I could show, hide, and export to demonstrate interactions that could only happen if we found a proper codejockey to build them, I also grew out of them faster than you can say, "It's definitively futile to design dynamic products in a static medium." That is if you speak whale, and speak slowly, because I made me some Brobdingnagian PSDs. That insanity has long since passed, and I've wrestled the HTML/CSS/JS hydra long enough to know that when seeking to re-envision the UXspectrum, I had to start somewhere interactive, somewhere open source, somewhere fuxing UXy.

And here you've landed, on the new landscape of UX. Take my word for it. I haven't asked anyone else.
