# TURNT

version 2 of a platform for passive, wearable, augmented reality

## TURNTerms

* **TURNT** - *LEDmob* => bomDEL => da bomb => bombs => dynamite => TNT => **TURNT** => **TURNT**
* **Flux** - the rate of change of an artist’s audience’s understanding of that artist’s transmitted meaning
* **Daisy chain** - when TURNTs connect physically, chains are formed. They smell funky.

## TURNT modules

* a headband with a mesh of tiny LEDs and radio transponder
* a pair of gloves with accelerometers and an LED array on the fingertips and palms
* a pair of socks or legwarmers with accelerometers and a mesh of tiny LEDs
* a hoodie with a mesh array of tiny LEDs and strings of larger LEDs along the seams and around the edge of the hood
* a central module with the cpu, and the ability to communicate with the other modules via radio (ZigBee, Bluetooth, WiFi), and a Bluetooth/Wifi uplink to one's smartphone
* a smartphone paired to the skully that brings in local and social data, parsing it into context-responsive light patterns
* A DJ booth equipped with live crowd analytics
* A TURNTstar in the DJ booth massaging the crowd-artist feedback loops to optimize the crowd’s experience and the artist’s *[[flux]]*

## TURNT platform

* a mesh network bound to a distributed graph database on a benevolent all-powerful server, which is a bit of an anti-god
** The *mesh network* allows /*mesh-heads*/mesheads to offer their bandwidth to other mesheads. Transmit wherever they are with whomever they are with.
** The *graph database* allows for transmissions to find similar transmissions directly, index-free and associative
** Their *benevolent omnipotent* server takes everyone’s requests, screens them, channels them, connects them.

## mass TURNT events

* With enough adjacent TURNTS, algorithms and admins can suggest, inject, and predict patterns that result in crowd-inspired displays in the crowd itself. Admin privvies can be granted to the venue, the artist, or the crowd. Usurp the beat, you TURNT!

* The Artist can impel the crowd to become the light show. The Crowd can fuel that show with their enjoyment of the festivities in a programmatic fashion. Every TURNT in the crowd is an AR input and output.

* An opt-in experience that ties you to the TURNTs around you. Their experiential data collected via distributed sensors, aggregated, and returned to the TURNTs.

## TURNT bennies (benefits)

* Immediate, automated inclusion for TURNTs with one another.
* Authentic, real-time, rich feedback for the Artist
* True oneness through a potentially end-to-end n-to-n experience

## How to get TURNT up

* pin a chip to your clothesbod
* assemble your ensemble to include a top, a bottom, gloves, boots, and a hat, or any of the above. the easiest multiple choice of your life.
* wire the chip to your ensemble
* each component of an ensemble is a TURNT; each ensemble is a TURNT; each TURNT is a TURNT
* IRL TURNTs can employ [[daisyChains-an]] androgynous plug format-to physically connect and amplify their impact
