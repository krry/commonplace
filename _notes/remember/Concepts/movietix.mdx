# The True Box Office Champion
The formula for determining the true box office champion of all time is really quite simple.  We just have to isolate ticket sales from the other variables that muddy the waters.  Let's list the ingredients of that mud:
1. average price per ticket
2. adjusted value of the dollar
3. disposable income per capital
4. total available seats over all showings
