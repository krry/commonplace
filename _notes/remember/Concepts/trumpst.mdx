You must be able to vote to play.

(Voting eligibility is determined by a plurality vote of the players. You don't need to exercise your vote to play.)

## Objective

The objective of the game is to build trust with other players.

▶️🕊️🚫💞💗

## Set and setting

Players occupy a common space and can communicate in "real" time.

🦴🤝👣👁️🤼👯💫

There are ample green, yellow, and red cards at hand. Per player you will want:
- 3x yellows
- 1x greens
- 1x reds
- other playful accoutrements and apparati, e.g., frisbees, bouncy balls, silks, velvets, and other luxe cloths, paulo santo, bebidas and hydratants, pillows of many shapes and sizes, entheogens, nootropics, psychotropics, oils/lotions

## Gameplay

It is always your turn. You may often have to assert that it is your turn, and you may often be ignored. Be civil about it. Better yet, be compassionate. Build trust. Breed bliss. Have fun.

## Broad strokes

1. You are already playing the game.
2. You cannot win or lose. You can only enjoy the game or not.
3. When you act, you will receive feedback.
4. If you act with and according to consent and follow your intuition, you will feel good and love the game.
5. If you don't, you will feel bad and wish you weren't playing the game.

## Moves

On your turn you have three moves:

1. **Overt action.** Ask consent to do something involving another player or players. You must be explicit af. If consent is unequivocally granted (with a witnessed "fuck yes 😀👍", hence the 3 player minimum) you may and must proceed with your request as described.
2. **Covert action.** Ask another player or players to trust you. "Trumpst me 😏🤞" If trust is offered, you may perform an action with or to them without first describing it entirely or at all.
3. **Inaction.** Recuse yourself to the fart patio.

If you do not ask for trust or consent, you have effectively recused yourself to the fart patio. Always be asking 😊

### Feedback

Once you have taken your turn, you will receive feedback from any or every other player.

At any time, other players may trump your move, literally and audibly: "Trump!"

- By acting, you have opened yourself to feedback. Refusing feedback earns you a yellow card.
- When you receive a red card, you must immediately recuse yourself to the fart patio and affix the HuffHose to your nose and mouth. This is not a position you will enjoy. You may want to quit the game at this point. But you cannot. You always play the game.
- If you have three yellow cards in your hand, you lose your turn and must reside on the fart patio indefinitely. (You regain your turn and may vacate the patio if you are granted a green card.)
- Otherwise the bar is ours: the day and the night and the car wash too, the matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars, the sun and the moon. And play continues. We are all winning. There is no winner.

## Cards

### Green cards

No one starts with green cards. There is a public pool of green cards equal in number to the playership.

Other players may grant you a green card at any time if you satisfy their stipulation. First, a player, on their turn (which is always), must propose the offer of a green card, stating who it is offered to, and the stipulation. Another player must wholly corroborate the offer.

"Let's give Ken a green card if he brings us each a bite of his birthday cake."

If another player confirms the green card proposal and stipulation before anyone trumps it or someone else takes their turn, you may choose to comply or not. Choose wisely. This may be your only ticket off the fart patio.

When a green card negates a yellow card, they are tossed back into the public pool.

### Yellow cards

Each player starts with two yellow cards in their hand.

A green card negates a yellow card.

You may grant a yellow card to any player on their turn if:
- they did not explicitly describe the action for which they requested consent, or
- they did not perform the consented action as described.

Firmly say "Trump" and hand the yellow card to the violent player.

For/four examples:
- "That's not an elbow! Here's your yellow card, firetrucker."
- "Over the rainbow means **over** the rainbow, not through it or under it. YELLOW'D!"
- "Meh. No me gusta. Consent revoked. Yellow is the card that I gave you."
- "What the waht! Get yellow."

If two other players disagree with your grant of a yellow card, it returns to you.

### Red cards

You don't want a red card.

The red card is a one-way ticket to federal pound-me-in-the-nose fart patio.

If you violate another player's trust, you get a red card.

If two other players permissably toss you a yellow card on one of your turns, you get a red card.

If you have three yellow cards in your hand at any point, you have a red card.

If you have less than three yellow cards, you do not have a red card.

## The Fart Patio

When on the fart patio, you can do what you like, but you may not interact with players who are not on the patio.

## The HuffHose

If you are on the fart patio and in possession of three yellow cards (i.e., a red card), you are fucked. On goes the HuffHose.

Switch your phone to airplane mode.
Gaze into the black mirror and nowhere else.
If you are enjoying yourself, close that app and do not open it again.
Good luck.

## Game over

It never is. You are winning if you are playing. No one player can win. If you are in denial about playing, you are losing, and are more than likely not enjoying yourself, which itself is losing.

# The point

Trust reigns supreme.
First consent.
Then bliss.
Safety third.

You can't win or lose 😋
Enjoy yourself!
