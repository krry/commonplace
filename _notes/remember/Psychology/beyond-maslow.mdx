# Maslow missed a step

Take it from anyone who self-actualized at a young age and then regressed like I have: Maslow missed a few steps, namely the higher-order ones. Once you self-actualize, greater issues become germane: societal, religious, ethico-moral, genetic, special, environmental, solar, galactic. These are extensions of Maslow's hierarchy which many of you have likely found to be obvious. The hierarchy is not a pyramid, nor does it have a ceiling or a last rung.
