# Flow according to Csikszentmihalyi

## Factors accompanying an experience of Flow
1. intense and focused concentration on the present moment
2. merging of action and awareness
3. a loss of reflective self-consciousness
4. a sense of personal control over the situation or activity
5. a distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered
6. experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience

Intense, focused concentration on the present moment occurs when I'm working with my hands, moving, engaged in an activity I am familiar with, but haven't done too much.  My concentration is focused when I know the particular goal I am working toward, when the success state is clear.  My concentration is intense when I believe that this goal or success state is the most important and pressing.  All of this concentration focuses intently on the present moment if there is no looming future obstacle, and no unresolved past paradox or problem.  This factor occurred many times when I stood at the plate, waiting for the pitch. I would like to experience this factor in my daily life, ideally while performing a valuable service, crafting something, learning something, or solving a problem.

A merging of action and awareness occurs when I know how to perform the action well enough that I can be aware of performing it and perform it all at once. Most of the time this requires me to be well-practiced at the action, and in the proper state of mind to perform it. This too often occurred while I played baseball. Each pitch I through, I was aware of my form while performing the action.

A loss of reflective self-consciousness is a very rare state for me.  Sometimes while riding my motorcycle, running, or cycling I reach this state.  Sometimes while writing, or more rarely drawing.  Never while "working" though.  This state only occurs where I am profoundly comfortable with the apparatus or medium with which I am working. This seems to be a goal of the yoga student.
