# Cynosure

1. Attractant of attention or admiration due to brilliance or interest
2. Provider of guidance or direction

From Greek, kynósoura, meaning a dog’s tail or rump aka a _bitch-ass_. Also their name for the Little Dipper, Ursa Minor, Osa Menor, which contains the North Star, Polaris, the source of direction for nocturnal navigators in this Age of Pisces within the Procession of the Equinoxes.

One might surmise that ancient sailors spent many a night adjusting their heading toward that cosmic hound pucker in the sky.
