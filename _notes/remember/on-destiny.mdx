# On Destiny, Evolutionarily Speaking

It occurs to me that one's sense of destiny may be closely tied to one's sense of distant future probabilities. Destiny is a nebulous concept, but one that seems to have sprung up in independently in multiple cultures. Consequently, I posit that there is a deeper connection between a sense of destiny and any human's evolutionary drive.

At this point, I'd like to alter the nature vs. nurture adage to nature vs. culture. In the case of destiny, it would seem that a misunderstood cultural concept has been derived from a deep-set natural force.
