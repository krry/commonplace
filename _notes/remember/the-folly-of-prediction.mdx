# The Time for Deadlines is Up

#### The Folly of Prediction and Rotten Capitalism

Conversations at work often remind me of [this Freakonomics episode](http://freakonomics.com/2011/06/30/freakonomics-radio-hour-long-episode-4-%E2%80%9Cthe-folly-of-prediction%E2%80%9D-2/) from a few years ago. We often talk of timelines, deliverables, timeframes, deadlines, due dates, projections, estimates, roadmaps, project plans. These are drivel: bad guesses disguised as work and work product. No one should pay for bad guesses, and you should not expect your employer to. I worry that organizations that spend a lot of money on bad guesses are not long for this world. Orgs that do not waste money on bad guesses will naturally supersede orgs that do.

So how did it come to this? How did such a counterproductive practice come to dominate our workplace culture? I look to incentive systems as determinants of cultural patterns.

### Time for an overreaching allegorical indictment!

A capitalistic economy has a life cycle. First, a bud appears on the Tree of Capitalism. Full of Millsian ideals, and healthy competition, and indefatigable work ethic, it blossoms, attracting buzzing insects that begin cross-pollination. But the flower petals soon wither and fall, revealing a tiny fruit. The germ has found its target. As the fruit grows, its promise swells. This economy will become the greatest the world has ever seen! There is no limit to what we can become.

The rind toughens and thickens to support the juicy corporations that cavitate it. The nuclear threat will protect us. But one day the corporations are too large and too many. The fruit falls from the Tree, and plummets to the ground. Its thick rind splits open on impact, a fissure that exposes those juicy corporate cavities. Bacteria inch their way from the ground into the fissure. They whisper of a return to glory. And the corporations invite them inside. A rotten stench wafts from the fissure as the bacteria infiltrate and feast upon the hapless juice.

"Tell us your ambitions, your hopes and dreams. Where do you want to go in life? When do you want to get there? Can you draw up a timeline for that? A project plan, if you will. That's right. Map those key deliverables. Set that deadline. We can always push it back. Your _dead_ line."

And once again the buzzing insects arrive, happily slurping up the nectar from the rotting carcass that was once a thriving capitalistic economy.

### That got dark.

And I think that's exactly my pointâ€”it's getting dark. The more we focus on predicting our progress, the less progress we can make. By starting the conversation with "What does the timeline look like?", we set ourselves up for failure, because the answer to that very first inquiry will invariably be wrong.

We love predicting the future. But we're very bad at it. Self-awareness of this deficient predilection can start anywhere. But if those we look to as leaders do not acknowledge it, if those that set organizational goals and objectives do not realize that setting the time at which we will achieve them is a hopelessly futile venture, then a cultural shift will be very difficult.

So push back. "When's the deadline?" What deadline? The only deadline I have is at the end of my life, and I certainly don't know when that is coming. "When's your deadline?"
