title: Alan Watts On Defining Nature
---
# Alan Watts On Defining NatureAlan Watts has this great talk on nature, wherein he expounds on the three perspectives humans have taken on nature throughout known history.

As he tells it, nature is either:
(1) a mechanism where all the gears turn and grind along,
(2) a drama where all the world's a stage, or
(3) nonsense, where the absurd assemblences and improbable beings define it.

I grew up in state 1. I reside in state 3. Passed through state 2 rather rapidly.
