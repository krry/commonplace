# Kybalion
## Some notes

## The Seven Hermetic Principles

### 1. Mentality

"THE ALL is MIND. All is in THE ALL. THE ALL is in all."

### 2. Correspondence

"As above, so below. As below, so above."

### 3. Vibration

"Nothing rests; everything moves; Everything vibrates."

### 4. Polarity

"Everything is dual. Everything has poles."
Every truth is half-false.

### 5. Rhythm

"Everything flows out and in; everything has its tides"

### 6. Causation

"Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause"

### 7. Gender

"everything has its masculine and feminine principles"
all things are generative

## Principle of Mental Gender

The mind is dual, split between "I" and "me".

## The Law of Use

"The possession of Knowledge, unless accompanied by a manifestation and expression in Action, is like the hoarding of precious metals â€” a vain and foolish thing. Knowledge, like Wealth, is intended for Use. The Law of Use is Universal, and he who violates it suffers by reason of his conflict with natural forces."
