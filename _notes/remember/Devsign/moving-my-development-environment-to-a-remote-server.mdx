# Moving my development environment to a remote server

This evolution is long overdue.

My trusted Macbook spent much of yesterday chugging and grinding as I multi-tasked and developed and sync'd all the things at once. iStat kept me aware of the struggle this wafer-thin waif of a lappy was enduring for the sake of my productivity. So last night I thawed out and charged up my old juggernaut MacBook Pro, in search of more RAM/cores/Hertz/flops.

Half an hour into the slew of requisite software updates and configurations, the **CHECK ENGINE** light came on. This 6-year-old battery may be on its last legs.

And then it dawned on me. I like developing in Linux better. There are millions of servers running Linux on SSDs all cloneable and Docker'd and shit. And the computing power per dollar ratio of these corn-fed farm servers is much higher thanks to sweet, sweet economies of scale. So I spat out a search query (`remote dev environment`) and quickly found [a trusty pioneer](https://medium.com/@felippenardi/how-to-setup-a-remote-development-server-from-stracth-2b1e6155464c) to point me to the trail through these woods. Other queries led me to cloud-hosted IDEs like Codenvy and Koding and Orion. But if history is any indicator, I'm going to end up with a fully custom environment, so I will just start in that direction at the beginning.

Felippe Nardi went ahead and made himself super useful by condensing and publishing his years of experience setting up and working from a remote dev environment. He [seems to have been inspired by](https://medium.com/@felippenardi/start-coding-from-an-ipad-d942ebe44c63) or in cahoots with Mark O'Connor, [who moved his workshop to an iPad and a Linode about 5 years back](http://yieldthought.com/post/31857050698/ipad-linode-1-year-later). A basket of thanks to both of you fellas!
