# Snowpiercer - How to ship it continuously

Snowpiercer, as you know, is the last hope of humanity. It is a perpetual motion machine, circling the Earth with its precious cargo: personnel. These personnel—the last vestiges of humanity—are carefully placed within Snowpiercer at their allotted stations, occupying their preordained particular positions, performing their discrete duties.

Among our personnel we have:

- users
- stakeholders
- designers
- developers
- coordinators
- engineers
- analysts
- testers

## As a user

## For stakeholders

## For designers

## For producers

## For architects

## For coordinators

## For developers: the new feature cycle

Developers, yours is a simple station. In come the tickets requesting features, out go the commits. But it's never quite that easy, is it? On Snowpiercer it can be.

If the designers and directors have performed their duties, the tickets are shimmering beacons of clarity and wisdom—a joy to read, and a pleasure to complete. Your role as a developer is to build the new features as specified, and to support them with tests that verify their operation and completion.

For each requested feature, you shall:

1. Branch `develop`, naming the new branch succinctly after the feature, e.g., `git branch feature/devzample`.
2. Write unit, functional, and/or integration tests that comprehensively describe the new feature.
3. Develop the feature, committing your progress as each test passes.
4. When the feature is complete, publish it to Github.
5. Submit a pull request for your feature branch into `develop`.
6. Ask the most relevant other dev in your pod for a code review of that pull request.
7. Field the reviewers comments and feedback, committing and publishing updates to the feature if necessary.
8. When the feature is approved, rebase your branch on `develop`, then merge your branch into `develop`. Feature finished!

## For engineers: releases, build, and deployment

Engineers, you ensure that Snowpiercer keeps running smoothly and perpetually. A perpetual motion machine is still a machine after all. This machine, like any other, needs monitoring, maintenance, tuning, and refinement to keep running. These are your duties.

Once the developers have finished a set of features, and the producers and coordinators have grouped the features into a coherent release that offers new and verifiable value to the users, your task begins.

## For analysts

## For testers
