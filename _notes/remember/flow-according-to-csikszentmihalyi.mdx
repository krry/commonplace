# Flow according to Csikszentmihalyi

## Factors of Flow

In his 1991 book, _Flow_, Csikszentimihalyi sums up the factors of flow:

1. intense and focused concentration on the present moment
2. merging of action and awareness
3. a loss of reflective self-consciousness
4. a sense of personal control over the situation or activity
5. a distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered
6. experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience

## The Facets of Flow

Then in [his 2004 TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_u-Eh3h7Mo), Csikszentmihalyi sums up the experience of flow thusly:

1. Completely involved in what we are doing â€” focused, concentrated.
2. A sense of ecstasyâ€”of being outside everyday reality.
3. Great inner clarityâ€”knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.
4. Knowing that the activity is doableâ€”that our skills are adequate to the task.
5. A sense of serenityâ€”no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.
6. Timelessnessâ€”thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by in minutes.
7. Intrinsic motivationâ€”whatever produces flow becomes its own reward

We might like to have some shorthand terms for these facets.

### 1. Focus

Focus appears to be, at least partially, dependent on the other facets. Is focus possible without clarity, without adequacy, without serenity?

Intense, focused concentration on the present moment occurs when I'm working with my hands, moving, engaged in an activity I am familiar with, but haven't become tired of. My concentration is focused when I know the particular goal I am working toward, when the success state is clear. My concentration is intense when I believe that this goal or success state is the most important and pressing. All of this concentration focuses intently on the present moment if there is no looming future obstacle, and no unresolved past paradox or problem. This factor occurred many times when I stood at the plate, waiting for the pitch. I would like to experience this factor in my daily life, ideally while performing a valuable service, crafting something, learning something, or solving a problem.

### 2. Ecstasy

A merging of action and awareness occurs when I know how to perform the action well enough that I can be aware of performing it and perform it all at once. Most of the time this requires me to be well-practiced at the action, and in the proper state of mind to perform it.

This, too, often occurred while I played baseball, especially as I became aware of my form while throwing each pitch. Dance easily becomes ecstatic, as does trail-running through the forest, cycling down a mountain, or ðŸ˜±ðŸ™€ washing the dishes.

### 3. Clarity

Clarity is perhaps an independent facet, or perhaps entwined with adequacy.

### 4. Adequacy

Adequacy is relatively independent as well, and bolstered by clarity.

### 5. Serenity

Serenity seems directly dependent upon clarity and adequacy.

A loss of reflective self-consciousness was once a very rare state for me. Sometimes while riding my motorcycle, running, or cycling I reach this state. Sometimes while writing, or more rarely drawing. Never while "working" though. This state only occurs where I am profoundly comfortable with the apparatus or medium with which I am working. This seems to be a goal of the yoga practicioner.

### 6. Kairos

The timelessness of kairos emerges in a state of ecstasy during an autotelic experience. Can kairos take effect without focus or serenity? Unknown, but worth exploring.

### 7. Autotelia

Flow is:

- for its own sake
- outright wonderful per se
- _ipso facto an sich_ ("in itself")
- reflexively pleasant

Does the autotelic experience arise without these other facets? I don't think we need adequacy, serenity, clarity for autotelia, but the rest seem linked.
