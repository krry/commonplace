# Awaken to Dream

## The origin story of Hermes Trismegistus

We meet a boy who sees the truth. Anything is amusing, everything is a game.

## Themes

- Natural Law
- Radical Self Reliance
- Mindfulness
- Unity/Interconnectedness

The hermetic principles are first learned then applied along the journey: Mind, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Causation, Gender. We see how the principles interplay.

### Time Cycles On

Different spans of time pass in order to illustrate the cycles of life: an hour, a day, a week, a month, a year, 4 years, 9, 18, 36, a lifetime, a town, a culture, a civilization, an ecology, a solar system, a galaxy, a universe, a photon, an electron, a tree, a bird, a cloud, a glacier/iceberg, a storm, a colony, a flower, a virus.

### Nature has its way

A child learns mindfulness from simple creatures who readily discern feelings from thoughts, and needs from wants. Self-reliance and self-expression serve the whole Self, not merely the individuals. The interconnectedness of everything becomes starkly clear as the child ventures away from the bustle of the tribe.

## Inspirations

The story does not overtly refer to Hermes Trismegistus, the Kybalion, or other figures and works of Hermetic philosophy. References are playful and guised.

A fictional book that appears in an ancient Egyptian story. It contains two spells: one that allows the reader to understand the speech of animals, and another that allows the reader to perceive the gods themselves.

When [Setne Khamwas](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Khaemweset) tomb-raids Neferkaptah and steals the book, he has a horrible dream and learns that the gods' knowledge is not meant for humans to possess.
