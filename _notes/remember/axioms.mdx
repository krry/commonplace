# Axioms

When we talk about **axioms**, we draw from the Greek ἄξιος (áxios) meaning "being in balance, worthy, proper". Axioms are the statements we see fit to accept. They are obvious, apparently true, and difficult or impossible to prove. When we question everything, eventually we arrive at the axioms. Few can recite them, few question them. We act as though we believe the axioms without really knowing them.

Penelope Maddy brilliantly develops this conundrum in regards to the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in her paper, ["Believing the Axioms"](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms1.pdf).

"… \[P\]rinciples must be judged from the point of view of science, and not science from the point of view of principles fixed once and for all," wrote Zermelo, in 1908, in support of the Axiom of Choice, which Peano sought to strike out of his arithmetic.

[[axioms-and-postulates]] are often conflated.

I once attempted to ground a series of as-yet unwritten short stories in a set of [[axioms-of-atman]] that support the [[themes-of-atman]].
