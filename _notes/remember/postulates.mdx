# Postulates

Postulates, on the other hand, are not self-evident, but are simply taken as given. We are asked to allow for the truth of postulates, suspending disbelief while we examine the fruit of their loom.

Euclid put forth one of the earliest formal system of [[axioms]] of geometry in his Elements.

Don Miguel Ruiz's Four Agreements could be seen as postulates of one's morality.

According to the principle of causality, the circumstances/condition/situation of the current moment would be different if any past choice had been made differently. However we have never been able to repeat a past choice differently to test this. Hence the current moment was inevitable, and causality is unfalsifiable.

Causality is one of the postulates of logic.
