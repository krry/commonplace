> "Modern culture has nevertheless been willing to embrace ignorance to a much greater degree than has any previous culture. One of the things that has made it possible for modern social orders to hold together is the spread of an almost religious belief in technology and in the methods of scientific research, which have replaced to some extent the belief in absolute truths."

> — Yuval Noah Harari. "Sapiens."

We protest religion now, wielding pickets, shouting "We believe in science!" We buy techno-indulgences to salve our guilty consciences at having greedily consumed our planet's resources beyond repair. We long to be the Guardians of the Galaxy, to slake our Candy Crushes, to span our Oculus Rifts.

These are the times of which sense I will not make. Our times are not unique in this respect, for the human condition looms a bewildering tapestry of celebrated nonsense and fortunate absurdity. Instead we miss (but don't really miss) the swelling opportunity to recognize our ignorant follies. We peddle denial rather than paddle the Nile. We consume constant distractions rather than confront greed's consequences.

Are these technocracies we build, are they our dreams brought to waking life? Are we woke af? Or are these the dreams left unresolved as our eyes bat awake into the nightmares we have wrought in steel and dipped in black gold? Those uncertain dreams we ache to continue, if only to deliver us from the hazy dawn of a tomorrow we did not foresee.

Technology need not be our religion, nor Science our goddess. If we can dig down to the roots of Science herself, embrace her sturdy girth, and climb into her lofty limbs, we stand a chance of hurdling our hapless plight.

Science freaks, if you're with me, throw up a Hail Mary! Sing a science prayer!

No, no. Not like this. Not a _MEME_!

Science, if it were a religion, has simple tenets:

1. You will be wrong.
2. Ask why.
3. Use your maths.
4. Record the answers.
5. Try again.

Those who "because", or think they are right, or can't square up a million need not apply to the Church of Science-ology. It won't be easy as 3.14159… You will not know when you will die, and food that is good can be food that is fried.

Ideas? Comments? Questions? Donations of gourmet cash dollar bill moneys from around the world (not really, tho, in my currency)? How was your yoga retreat? Did you find yourself… bending in new ways in a new place? I wonder if these souvenir Baht could have made someone hungry happy. But they're mine now, so you can wonder and I'm going to the petting zoo.
