# Uxioms

## Axioms for designing a user's experience

### 1. Instructive Animation

- Show, don't teach.
- Primary learning occurs by doing and failing.
- Secondary learning occurs by listening and trying to repeat.
- Tertiary learning occurs by failing to repeat and studying.

### 2. Examples belong with categories

- Archetypes signify and illustrate groups.
  - Don't explain categories, exemplify them.

### 3. Be easy on the eyes

- Scannability. Then readability.
- Most users scan, then read.
- Follow suit, don't force it.

### 4. Be polite. Map real life to your experience.

- speak to your user like a flesh-and-blood customer
- error messages are the designers' mistakes, not the users'
- Users tend to blame themselves when things go wrong; don't blame them

### 5. Minimalism - design, then subtract!

- don't provide options, unless demanded
- direct your user, instead of catering to them

### 6. Storyboarding: play out the scenarios

- write your characters
- write your plots
- build your stages
- play - seek mutual enrichment

### 7. Color: be judicious

- no day starts bright
- mimic mating rituals, flashes of color
- contrast is the key, not flair

### 8. Re: Meaning, Pictures > Words

- to convey a deeper message, focus on nonverbal communication
- focus on implications of visual and interactive design

### 9. Re: Information, Words > Pictures

- to convey information, focus on clear, readable language
- information architecture is paramount

### 10. Feedback - less choices, less error

- Choices introduces error. More choices introduce more error.
- More users mis-select on a 5-point scale than a 2-point scale.
- Maximize the accuracy of your feedback.
- Ask yes or no questions; accept explanations.

### 11. Use your dimensions

- map the use to the case
  - e.g., long-scrolling for long interest
  - e.g., quick steps for fleeting interest
  - leave space to breathe where possible

### 12. Aim for the majority

- be messier and larger, rather than structure and complet

### 13. Technology is hard to understand

- Don't pretend otherwise.
- You are smart; but don't be a spacehuman.

### 14. Precede trends with honesty

- Don't bet your great ideas on a fad
- Your scary new idea could become a trend.

### 15. Know your worthwhile

Who benefits from the data you volunteer?

- You or (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon)?

### 16. Respect your elders?

Infotech tends to take no prisoners.
Software will eat the world.

- Microsoft abstracted us from efficient data entry
- Apple abstracted us from personal data/media centrism
- Amazon abstracted us from literature
- Facebook abstracted us from earnest social interaction
- Google abstracted us from our unrealized, nascent desires

### 17. Offer [[omotenashi]]

### 18. Tit-for-tat Plus Plus

Turn at least two cheeks before striking back

The most successful strategy in the Game of Life as described by Richard Dawkins in the Selfish Gene

### 19. Make no assumptions

When entering a new space, examine the premises. Question the foundation until it is rock solid, then begin to build. This process leads us back to [[first-principles]] and often yields [[tenets]].

Started writing [[uxioms-spec]] for a UXioms website way back when. Think I once had [uxioms.com][] and let it lapse for lack of putting anything there.
