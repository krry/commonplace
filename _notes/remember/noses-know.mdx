# A nose knows not what it seeks

I grew up with a beagle. Or rather she grew up with me. She is now long gone and I was honored to witness the effulgence of her formative years. Her name was **Floppy**. She sniffed for something special with every beat of her little hound heart. Her search for the Holy Smell led her everywhere: tirelessly to the drains of the world, indefatigably to the bottom of a neighbor's diaper pail. She may have been a poophound. But then again, we all eat shit now and then.

In the grassy lawn of the backyard of my childhood home, I could drag a twisty, turny hundred-foot trail with a Milkbone while she was in the house sleeping soundly. Then if I didn't let a sleeping dog lie (inadvisably) but instead keyed her into the source of that twisty trail, she would follow every turn. I learned that I could keep the Milkbone in hand until she'd followed the path I traced for her. She learned that those paths were worth carefully tracing. Neither of us knew the weight of our childhood games or the deeper truths they manifested.

Dogs have a superior sense of smell, as they say, especially beagles and other hounds. Since knowing Floppy I've become somewhat of a hound, and a bit of a cat. I carry her with me, and the spirits of Jasmine, and Rocky, Lana, Sterling, Cubbie's, Carlough's, Ronin's, Buckley's among the animals I have known well over the years. For brevity I must leave out all of the human animals whose spirits I carry with me, though theirs have been the most precious spirits to bear. Another topic for another day…

Anyhow, our expressed senses are mere proxies for our deeper understandings of the vibrations of the universe around us. "I smell bergamot," she says. But does she? Or does she detect some semblance of once-adjacent waves that occurred closely enough to the word 'bergamot' and this boy's mind that the sense and the word intertwined in his mind?

## A scent can carry many meanings.

A scent is information. It is a nebulous semblance of particles, wafted over a sensory array at a point in time. These particles may have originated in very different places, or very much the same place. The vast majority of them descend from Sol: they result from our Sun's beginning, or they result from the results of our Sun becoming itself.

## Long ago, a star was born.

Dust from the intense birth scattered all around. The star was immense, so it drew some of its scatterings back to it, to orbit it in measured ellipses. The scatterings self-sorted by density—perhaps by _meaning_—as they swirled about the young Sun. They danced together, they fought. They collided and intertwined. They fused and fizzed. A special cluster of these scattered misfits, this unusual detritus, banded together and hurricaned into a globe. Its core fused into iron. The outer members of the band clung to the metal sphere as they too were melted into it. They built a mantle to honor their good fortune, and to shield the more delicate scatterings from the volcanic violence of the core.

Then came the crust. The outermost scatterings gradually settled as fertile dust upon the cooling mantle. They had been cautiously hovering around the heat and violence, a mindful haze of æther and stardust. But they eventually collapsed under the weight of their self-knowledge and rested for a bit. They found themselves piled into stochastic heaps, nestling into configurations of comfort. Coriolis swept in, blowing some of them about. Some got very wet as the ozone oozed into the sea. Many of them drowned, and their cast-off shells piled into mountains. Some lucky few set seed on the hills and dales that rose from the waves. Still others swam religiously, breathed in the ooze and plumbed its depth. The xylem phloemed. They pooled and divided and carpeted the crust.

## Then one stood.

In a relative flash, that one became many and covered the globe. They conquered, vanquished, tamed, or consumed any others they encountered. They began to understand that this world would not be enough for them. So they figured out how to return to the stars that were their origin. They rocketed off into the void—ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

# Follow your nose

All this is a roundabout way of telling you to follow your nose. The world as we know it was assembled by particles who sniffed each other out despite vast spaces and vast improbabilities. If we are all just stardust, then we can't trust our eyes, or our ears, or even a warm embrace. But like my indulgent hound Floppy, we can trust our noses.
