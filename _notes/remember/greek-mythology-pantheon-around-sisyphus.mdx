    - Ananke, maybe
    - Erebus and Nyx collided inward to form **Aether** (upper air, Light) and **Hemera** (Day, 'Dies' to the Romans).
    - Nyx via Erebus also birthed:
      - **Thanatos** (Death)
      - **Nemesis**, the punisher of hubris, the distributor of fortune.
        - Nemesis spawned an egg containing two sets of twins:
          - **Helen** of Troy and **Clytemnestra**, and
