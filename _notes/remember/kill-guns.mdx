# Disarmed: An Open Letter to Civilians with Guns

## Hypotheses

1. Support for guns correlates negatively with proximity to other citizens.
2. Gun-related deaths correlate positively with urban density and negatively with wealth density.
3. When population density exceeds k people/sq.mi., more guns correlates with more shootings.

Dear Gun-toting US Civilian,

I heard the news today. You've probably heard it too. The son of a kindergarten teacher in Newtown, Connecticut, visited his mother's classroom this morning. Adam, her 20-year-old lad, borrowed some of her things, borrowed her car, and arrived just before classes started. He had also borrowed an ID from his brother, who was off at work in the Big Apple this morning.

Adam thought he'd make this a visit to remember, so he donned his most expensive clothes, and tried to get there on time. As luck would have it, he was a little late. The school day had already begun when he arrived. The kids and teachers, K-4, had salready settled into a usual day. That is, until they heard desperate screams emanating from the elementary school's P.A. system. "kcckkckcfffft..... oooohhhh God, nnnnnnnoo"

#### Common topics of debate around gun reform

- Responsible gun owners can snap or lose their guns
  - "Self-defense" often results in death
  - Well-trained kid gunners
    - Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden in Jonesboro, AK, March 24, 1998
- Legally vs. illegally owned guns
- Historically irresponsible treatment of gun ownership
- Aggregate cost-benefit of gun ownership in America by lives
- Aggregate cost-benefit of gun ownership in America by money
- Psychological disorders and mental health
- Failures of accidentally toting heroes
- Protection of individual liberty against government rule

Today, innocent Americans suffered yet another grave tragedy at the hands of a madman with a gun. With a reported 26 people now dead in Connecticut and 2 more dead in New Jersey at the hands of Adam Lanza ([cnn](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/14/us/connecticut-school-shooting/index.html) | [fox](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/14/at-least-27-dead-in-shooting-at-connecticut-school/)), it's time to put our emotional partisan biases aside and move the gun control debate along. For the children. To save future lives. We must interrupt the uninformed diatribes being chanted that have repeatedly stalled out progress toward a real solution.

#### We've seen several gun-fueled massacres in the US this year:

- at the movie theater in Aurora, CO ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting) | [cnn](http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/30/us/colorado-theater-shooting/index.html) | [fox](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/07/20/deadly-shooting-colorado-movie-theater-dark-knight-rises/))
- at the Gurdwara in Oak Creek, WI ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Sikh_temple_shooting) | [cnn](http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/06/us/wisconsin-temple-shooting/index.html) | [fox](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/08/05/possible-injuries-after-shooting-at-sikh-temple-in-wisconsin/))
- at the shopping mall in Portland, OR

Don't bother debating whether guns or people kill people. Don't bother debating the intent of the forefathers in drafting the 2nd Amendment. Don't bother calling for better psychiatric care, claiming we need to treat the cause. Don't bother calling for metal detectors and armed guards in every building innocent people frequent. Don't be a fool. Look at the information widely available to all of us and make an informed decision to help lessen the number of tragic deaths resulting from gunshot wounds.

#### Allow me to save you some time searching for the straight poop on gun self-defense, gun violence and, gun control:

1.  The [NRA](http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/did-you-know.aspx) [often](http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/articles/2012/right-to-carry-2012.aspx) [relies](http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/articles/1999/armed-citizens-and-crime-control.aspx) on [this 1995 Kleck &amp; Gertz study](http://concealedguns.procon.org/sourcefiles/Kleckarmed.pdf) to purport that there are ~2.5M defensive gun uses (DGUs) each year.
2.  [This 1997 Hemenway study](http://www.saf.org/lawreviews/hemenway1.htm) all but invalidates the Kleck &amp; Gertz study on methodological grounds.
3.  [This 2000 Hemenway &amp; Azrael study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=187016) estimates that offensive gun uses outnumber DGUs by between 4 and 6 times. That's 4-6 crimes perpetrated with guns for every 1 prevented/interrupted.
4.  The Department of Justice has been administering [the National Crime Victimization Survey](http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245) (NCVS) annually since 1973. Its most recent DGU estimates are in the order of 100,000 per year, or about 1% of violent crimes were interrupted or prevented with a gun.
5.  [This blogger (Easy Bake Gun Club)](http://www.easybakegunclub.com) presents anecdotal evidence of [87 DGUs in November 2012](http://www.easybakegunclub.com/blog/1902/November-2012-Defensive-Gun-Use-Report.html) (and [85 in October](http://www.easybakegunclub.com/blog/1174/October-2012-Defensive-Gun-Use-Report.html)), many of which involved gunshot wounds or deaths. Extrapolating that number gives us around 1,000 "newsworthy" DGUs this year.
6.  William Krouse did oodles of research in preparing [this Nov. 14, 2012, report on Gun Control Legislation](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32842.pdf). Notably, gun suicides now outnumber gun homicides about 5 to 3, and roughly two-thirds of murders last year were gun-related.
7.  Here's [an encyclopedia](http://books.google.com/books?id=H_RrLyV9rDUC&pg=PR31&lpg=PR31) for anyone really interested in guns in America.
8.  The Harvard School of Public Health has unsurprisingly beaten me to compiling [a list of much of the relevant academic research](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use/index.html). Understandably, it's quite biased toward Harvard researchers' publications.

By no means take my research as complete. I'm relatively satisfied that I have a clear understanding of the costs and benefits of civilian gun possession. But please continue to inform yourselves beyond the pseudo-religious pro-gun or anti-gun stances that many Americans blindly espouse.

#### Here's my bottom line

There is no single cause of this year's tragic massacres. Not all of the perpetrators were suicidal. Not all of the perps were disillusioned young men. Not all of them were ex-military. They didn't all target religious groups, or family members, or strangers. But the single common factor is that all of the perpetrators used guns. And it's the factor that we as a nation have the most influence over. We can't wholly prevent people from becoming woefully upset and homicidal, but we can work to systematically detect and remove dangerous mechanical objects from our physical environment.
