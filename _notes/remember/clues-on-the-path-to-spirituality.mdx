# Clues on the Path to Spirituality

Spirituality is personal.

- Tom Campbell says in _My Big TOE_:

The pineal gland is the gateway between the physical and spiritual realms.

- This small organ, the size of a grain of rice, shaped like a pinecone, starts as a bud in the palate of a fetus and migrates into the center of the brain.
- At day 49 in the gestation of a human being, it finds its seat there at the center. Day 49 is also the typical point at which the gender of a fetus can be detected. The Tibetan Book of the Dead tells us that it takes 49 days for a soul to become untethered from its last host.
- The pineal gland holds the highest concentration of serotonin in the human body.
- The pineal gland produces DMT in humans and in rats.

DMT

- N,N-Dimethyltryptamine
- Called the spirit molecule
- Bioenzymatically only a few steps away from:
  - Psilocin
  - Psilocybin
  - Serotonin
  -
- DMT is present in many plants, notably in ayahuasca, with which is paired an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) to prolong the effects of orally administered DMT.

Brain = antenna

- Many who have had deeply spiritual experiences and awakenings would cast the brain as an antenna that sends and receives transmissions to and from the spiritual realm.
- Science fails to explain where the consciousness, mind, memory, or soul reside within our physical bodies or our brains.
- Rupert Sheldrake suggests that our memories may result from morphic resonance, which is a paranormal influence by which a pattern of events or behavior can facilitate subsequent occurrences of similar patterns.
