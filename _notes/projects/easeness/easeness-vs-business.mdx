# Easeness vs. Business

## Easeness Name Play

Anywhere business is mentioned, we want to slot in "easeness". As you might imagine, there are dozens, even hundreds, of idioms involving "business" that signify how beholden, how violated, how usurped we sovereign few have become by the pursuit of progress. Business dominates the narrative in almost every sector these days. These days even the realms supposed to benefit our well-being have been poisoned by business, infected with toxic hurry. Look at healthcare (at least in the West) and you'll find mostly diagnoses and treatments according to redeemable insurance codes, prescription drug lobbyists puppeteering the doctor next door, hospital administrations on the take from Big Pharma, and generally an obsession with illness where wellness is ostensibly the goal.
