# How I Built This

I first encountered the digital garden when I stumbled upon [@yenly's Notes to Self](https://til.yenly.wtf/notes/how-i-built-this). Eureka! It became immediately clear what I had to build. So when it came time to muster my courage and go public with all these crazy, incoherent ramblings, I dutifully tried a bunch of other approaches and avenues, and then eventually returned to @yenly's template [[foamy-nextjs]]. [[For Reasons]]. If you'd like to know [[why-i-chose-foamy-nextjs]], allow me to regale you. I've also kept track of the [[Bumps in the Foamy Dev Trail]], which might be useful to others going this way.

Devsign-wise, I've begun to develop a color palette from the birthday of my young son Zephyr. There's a light and dark theme so far, the moonface switch for which I hand-rolled into a single file component that can be dropped into a Next app. #todo, share a gist of that. The typography arrives via @fontsource which allows us to serve Google Fonts and beyond with the payload of the site, and to fine-tune precisely which font files are sent. I try to dial this in to lighten cargo.

### [[foam]] is great
