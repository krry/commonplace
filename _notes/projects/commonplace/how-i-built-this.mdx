# How I Built This

I first encountered the digital garden when I stumbled upon @yenly's [Notes to Self](https://til.yenly.wtf/notes/how-i-built-this). Eureka! It became immediately clear what I had to build. So when it came time to muster my courage and go public with all these crazy, incoherent ramblings, I dutifully tried a bunch of other approaches and avenues, and then eventually returned to the [[foamy-nextjs]] template for fast page loads thanks to SSG, and familiarity with NextJS. More on [[why-i-chose-foamy-nextjs]].

I've also kept track of the [[bumps-in-the-foamy-dev-trail]], which might be useful to others going this way.

Devsign-wise, I've begun to develop a color palette from the birthday of my young son Zephyr. There's a light and dark theme so far, the moonface switch for which I hand-rolled into a single file component that can be dropped into a Next app. #todo, share a gist of that. The typography arrives via @fontsource which allows us to serve Google Fonts and beyond with the payload of the site, and to fine-tune precisely which font files are sent. I try to dial this in to lighten cargo.

### [[foam]] is great

- [Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes)

### Next was Now, kind of

- [Mastering Next](https://masteringnextjs.com/) - a brilliant (free) course from [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io) who also offers [React 2025](https://react2025.com/)
- [Learn NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
- [NextJS Examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples)

### Examples and Features

- image in markdown [[eg-excalidrawn]]
  - [[eg-next-image-component]]
- [[eg-numbered-footnotes]] in subfolder using remark footnotes
- [[eg-jsx-component-in-mdx]]
