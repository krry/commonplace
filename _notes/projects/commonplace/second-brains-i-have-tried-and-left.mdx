# Second Brains I Have Tried And Left

## SBIHTAL

- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/app/atmanaut)
  - was really fascinating and taught me a lot, except:
  - it requires connectivity
  - it loads slow and slowly
  - they wouldn't let me self-host for < $500
  - forces content into outline format
  - isn't pretty, hard to restyle
  - feature rich, but hard to customize
  - too prescriptive
- Athena or whatever they call the open source roam
  - shares most of the issues above
- [Obsidian app](https://obsidian.md)
  - convinced me to return to markdown after exporting my Roam graph
  - too opinionated and constrained in a single Mac app
  - I soon started to wonder if I could use Obsidian **and** ……… Foam?
