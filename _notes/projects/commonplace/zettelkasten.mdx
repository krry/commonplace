# Zettelkasten

Literally "card index", in ze german.

Roam and them have looked into this a good bit. Easy to find a deep dive on that. Like [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) for which Andy built an interface where multiple notes can visible at once and with a hover state for peeking at the summary of a note. Andy argues for what he calls [[evergreen-notes]]
