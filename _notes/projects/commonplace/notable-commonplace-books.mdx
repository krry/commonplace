# Notable Commonplaces

For Neil Mather, [doubleloop.net](https://doubleloop.net) is the stream, and [the corresponding garden](https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/) is a commonplace. Neil tends the garden with `org-roam` in `Emacs` then exports it as HTML before publishing that HTML manually via Wordpress. I do not envy Neil's process.

Andy Matsuchak's Working Notes are wonderfully well-thought and well-presented. I'll surely be stealing the multi-note interface. Also I love his concept of [[evergreen-notes]] and aim to adopt this method.
