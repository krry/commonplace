# Second Brain

A similar pursuit to the digital garden, but more focused on knowledge retention, digestion, taxonomy, interweaving, transmutation, regurgitation, than the whimsical, serendipitous left-handed toss some shit up there and see what lands in the _good_ dirt.

Zander Kettleman keeps [a huge box of second brains](https://github.com/KasperZutterman/Second-Brain) on Github. Sorry, Kasper Zutterman.
