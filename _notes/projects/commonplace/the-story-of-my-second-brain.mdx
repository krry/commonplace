# The Story of my Second Brain

## The [[ourstory]] of my [[second-brain]]

- My second brain spent its early years on my trusty 2001 iMac and 2003 [[iceBook]] G3 as a growing mess of `rtf`s and `txt`s. Back then, computers were made of plastic, they were mere toys, not these serious monolithic black mirrors we worship today. So I gave my second brain little mind and spent most of my time drowning my first brain in cheap beer. With little rhyme, reason, or rigor, there is little to report from this period, save a handful of mortally embarrassing spoken word pieces, aka raps. If you're craving a cringe, feel free to poke the bear.
- These soon lived on Dropbox as I trudged through law school. There I learned to outline in astounding detail at a nauseating speed. And to win arguments before they begin without sounding like I'm arguing. And to drink whiskey every day. Anyway, lots of notes of very little value outside of a soft IP practice.
