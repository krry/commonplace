# Nameless

## Intro/Background

- A Paean to the [[yijing]]
- A [web app](https://nameless.easeness.biz) built with Vue 3

> The babies were little stars from Spiritland, and … when they first came to the earth … they were from the sky and _nameless_.
> — via the Osage Indians
> from Mamatoto, a book at the SF Birth Center by Carroll Dunham

Throughout the [[yijing]] we encounter nameless pawns: arrogant dragon, the forester, the young fool, the superior man, the maiden, the great prince, a petty man, the Son of Heaven, the Supreme Deity. Owing its admittedly masculine lean in modern interpretation to the many centuries of androcracy this timeless work of balance and harmony has endured as the pendulum has reached its Martian zenith today (we stand now at the moment of stillness before the pendulum swings back), the men, the maidens, the dragons, are not the protagonists of this story. The [[yijing]] tells a story of the changes we experience, of the moments of choice in which we manifest what is to be, of the cusps and corners and junctures of the 10-D multiverse.

  - The character Gua for hexagram is the character for sundial with the radical for divining added to it.
- [The sun creates the Taiji](https://www.yijing.nl/origins/gui-gua/gui-gua-taiji.html)
  - The Taiji is a map of changing light as seasons cycle
- [Yìjīng is the Book of Ease](https://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/yinyang.htm)
  - 易 change, ease, sun over moon
  - 經 book, classic, profound book

## Design Thinking

- A grid of tiles with cards that hover over.
- Each tile contains a change from among the 64.
- A change comprises an array of names and numbers and interpretations, the longer aspects of which are portrayed on the card, while the shorter bits are framed about the tile.
- The guest is invited to produce the burning question of the moment, then asked and instructed how to divine the change that applies to it using three coins.
- Entering the result of the divination, the guest sees the tile of that change highlit and the card displayed in detail.
- One side of the card displays the written interpretations of the change, while the other side explores the two trigrams of which its six lines are composed, and the image they form together.
- If any of the lines in the guest's cast are changing, the guest sees that line of the hexagram highlit, and tapping it, sees the written interpretation of that changing line.
- The guest may also explore the changes without presenting a question, tapping tiles to see their cards, and flipping the cards as desired.

#### Interaction

- [ ] zzfx on reveal answer and show oracle
- [ ] arrow keys to move between tiles
- [ ] show adjacent cards with arrows
  - [ ] add tappable arrows on sides of card
  - [ ] keyboard arrow nav
- [ ] Shift or meta click on tiles to keep the others open
