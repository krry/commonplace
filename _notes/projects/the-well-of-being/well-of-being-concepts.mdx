## Value of Play

- what are we saving life from?
- can we die as playfully as we live?
- celebrate or prolong life
- defy and delay death or embrace it
- This coronation is our initiation into the service of sovereignty through caring life

## Codex of Truth

- according to seer Edgar Cayce, the as-yet hidden Hall of Records under paws of Sphinx contains holographic tablets of glass that tell the story of those who colonized Earth

## Song of Nature

- phi, the golden ratio, Fibonacci sequence, and laws of musical harmony present themselves throughout the evolved patterns, behaviors, and structures of nature

## Consorption

- following the principles of Morphic Resonance/Morphogenesis:
  - the habits of nature tend to evolve, and
  - similar beings of nature tend to learn/teach each other new habits by learn/teaching themselves
    - the daily crossword puzzle is easier at night
    - rats can solve a maze that lots of other rats across the world have practiced, or that their parents have practiced
- when a new path is discovered by a goat, all the goats consorb the new way. the goatherd, having habitually and intentionally tuned to the goats' field, consorbs their new knowledge as well
