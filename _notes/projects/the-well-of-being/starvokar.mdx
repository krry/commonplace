# Starvokar

aka Starvokans, Vokans, the Crystal Giants

## Where did the Starvokans come from? When did they arrive on Earth?

- Questions like these are hard to answer in any way that would satisfy your average terrestrian.
- A Vokan sometimes appears as an aphid, at other moments as a comet or a distant galaxy, or merely a twist in the breeze.
- For two thousand millennia (2,000,000 years) before the last Earthwide flood and the great ice age that preceded it, the Vokans made a habit of strolling blissfully through the great forests of Earth, leading the birds and bugs in song. They would flip through the seas singing with the whales, dance with the dolphins, dive with the squid.
- The Vokans know their place, their part in the song, their steps in the dance. So, like the birds just before dawn, they sing with confidence and gratitude, leading the chorus mightily.

### A Vokan has no doubts between strides.

- In truth, we are Vokans too, thought we do not remember ourself. We can, if we choose to, perceive as the Vokans do. Already we too sit, feel, think, and move in ten dimensions of space and time.

The giants built monoliths, obelisks, cities of caves, pyramids, ziggurats, temples;
their explorations expanded the heavens and embellished the earth.

The giants elevated/emerged into higher dimensions of being where other worlds were not light years away but a mere step in a new direction where time has shape.

Now the giants live in the heavens on worlds of which we can scarcely dream.
And they've left us clues anywhere and everywhere we look that we might follow them.

- All of Nature sings the song the giants perfected.
- We call these giants Starvokans or Vokans for short, as they are planeswalkers, to borrow from Magic The Gathering
  - from the Sanskrit
    - **star** meaning "level" from which we have the word "star", and
    - **vokar** meaning "traveler"
  - when Earthside, Vokans often are heard to call each other "Yatri" or "Satayatri"
    - from the Sanskrit, **satah** also means "plane"
    - from the Sanskrit, **yaatree** also means "traveler"
  - one can imagine a Celtic noble regaling us about the Starwalkers
    - and as it turns out, ancient Celtic and ancient Sanskrit share a common prehistoric linguistic root and wisdom tradition
- Incidentally, Starvokans are never far away, inhabiting the same 3D space as our Earth and its denizens, but quite invisible having stepped subtly or drastically away on the additional [[paraplanes]] they walk.
  - Though they sometimes appear very large to [[3-Dentify]]ing terrestrians, this is merely an artificial impression effected as a Starvokan flattens in the 4th and 5th spatial dimensions, redistributing its composing matter into the three the Earthlings can see.
    - By taking a step on either the 4th or 5th plane, they can vanish or appear, transmute or transform, as easily as they can shrink or grow before terrestrial eyes.
- The Limits of [[Sensation]] and [[roam/perception]]
  - The spectrum of vibrations our eyes, ears, brains detect is a narrow range of the wiggles we conceive to be possible.
    - Of light we see radiation of 380 nm wavelength up to 740 nm, not even half an order of magnitude.
    - Of sound we hear 20 Hz low notes up to 20,000 Hz high tones, and we can feel vibrations below that range.
    - Of scent and taste, we can detect a few hundred distinct Earthly volatile organic compounds in various concentrations and combinations. The range of other permutations is virtually limitless.
