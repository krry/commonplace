# 2 Wet Blanket Welders

"Don't forget to be afraid of wings,"
welders usher santima out 
where desk lay thick 
under tones singing mute
dust nymphs bringing loot
offerings caked in memory's soot

Ferns curling like toes refractory
spooning Nerf herders pool 
toward Earth mother turf flows 
squirrels glide to purge their swole 
And cheeks rise against 
In smiles as we meet 
 
grounded and Dusty the welders 
hold court for today's vespers 
crowing queens and kings
of passed-hour heroes
seated knees dirty seeing
lies amid beliefs

"You'll never make it
To the summit you seek.
stay and sit. save yourself 
for higher peaks," Welders
speak like daisies reek
havoc on lofty dreams.

Little spoon on giant rock 
Sentima tucks in limbs 
charging horn first
into the dream herd
a rhino bursts from bated breath 
an eagle alights on fates bereft

threadless and threatless
they spin pull sever regardless
