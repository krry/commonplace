- [[Nameless]] is out in the wild: [Nameless.easeness.biz](https://nameless.easeness.biz)
    - Oh gosh I deployed it, finally after four days of being in the weeds of a profound refactor.
    - This was hard. And took long hours of patience
    - Now building and devving with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) which is way faster than Webpack
        - Vite doesn't accept CommonJS only ESM
            -  NodeJS is founded in CommonJS, so doing Node-y things is hard like `fs` stuff in the filesystem
    - Found some bugs on mobile, shared with Kyle, gonna fix and regroup
- [[Circumcision]]
    - Elysa brought this up again today
        - She says I don't give her the space she needs around this
            - She is right, I crowd the zone with hell no
        - I get triggered when she is uncertain about this
            - Fear for my baby's well-being if his mother would harm him
            - Fear for my own safety if Elysa would harm her baby
            - Fear for Elysa that she would unwittingly harm herself in the name of dogma
            - __**And most of all, deep trauma from my own circumcision**__
                - I would not trim and slice my penis if given a choice
                - My baby has a choice through my volition
                - Hence I will not trim and slice his penis
    - It is pretty fucked up how deeply ingrained this systemic practice of violence against harmless, defenseless infants.
        - We both struggle with it.
        - Elysa doesn't like when I describe the actual act of circumcision: evidence that it is horrifying.
        - I don't like having undergone it without a vote, and I don't like the effect of it.
