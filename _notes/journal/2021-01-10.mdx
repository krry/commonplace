- a Surprising streak going here on the Diary
  It seems there is much left to be desired in the Android writing experience - Can't get a photo to upload, for example And I have tried many times
- Ooh, one return is soft, two becomes hard
  I like that.
- But it ends up making a new pip every two carriage returns.
- [[Nameless]] is going well. Finally cracked the Prestige yesterday, so it's shareable.
- Time to log bugs and spec features
  Then consider which new tech might support them and read the docs
  - I suspect Vuex or another central store will be helpful for state management
  - And Vue Router may enable info pages, and routes to each of the changes and or rolls.
    - Could statically generate a page for each hexagram easily
    - And could statically generate a side by side roll page for each permutation of the coins
  - We want to look into Nuxt as well
  - And we want a simple, low-touch login system, maybe email secrets
  - And a drawer in the interface? or a sidebar or navbar?
