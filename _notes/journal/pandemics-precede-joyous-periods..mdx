# Pandemics precede joyous periods.

Reading [this piece from The Conversation that draws strong parallels our present situation and the flu epidemic of 1918-1920](https://theconversation.com/people-gave-up-on-flu-pandemic-measures-a-century-ago-when-they-tired-of-them-and-paid-a-price-156551), it occurred to me that there was also a flu epidemic/pandemic in 1968, the [Hong Kong Flu](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hong_Kong_flu).

The periods that followed these two spans of widespread fear and shared tragedy are known as the Roaring Twenties and the Summer of Love respectively. Inductively, we stand on the doorstep of another mass effulgence event.
