- Today I embark on the [[Hexagram-a-Day]] project
    - each day I will use [[Nameless]] to do an [[Yìjīng]] reading
    - I will reference several interpretations of the resolving hexagrams
    - then I will write a new assembled interpretation here and add it Nameless
- Today's Hexagrams are [[2 Earth]] and [[59 Dispersion]]
