Literally "cow-i-fi-ed"

I'll not prolong this tale with anything non-toward.

Today my ticket was punched.

Elysa had scheduled me a shot at the Walgreens.

I complied. We have a new son, Zephyr, who is what Z is, which seems to be the Emperor, and/or the Dauphin or who knows what language they grok on the other side. Z said yes.

So, docile and compliant, I found myself to the ungreen walls of Walgreens. Reaching their portcullis I was quite nearly repelled. It would have been a lot more fun to rappel.

I chose the left arm. Painless jab of a sliver of a hair. Wait for 15 in the store, they required. I jet to the grocery, only to don a mask. Halfway back from hell, here for the meatloaf.
