- The days pass slowly when I work all day and night.
    - I have approached and accomplished much on the [[Nameless]] I Ching app in the past week.
        - Recently I have focused on learning the [[Reactivity]] API of [[Vue 3]]
        - Many of the challenges have been around the animations and transitions
        - And I struggle to understand the documentation, which is extensive and well-written
