# How I Can Enjoy Work Again

Somewhere out there gathers (or soon will gather) a group who share enough of my values, interests, and sensibilities such that we can empower each other to reach profound states and rates of flow as we create, develop, refine, deliver what we love to the world. If I can clarify these factors for myself, I can seek them out in others, and can then offer my heart, mind, and body to them in play and for fair pay.

## Perspective Shift
### The Outside View

xx% of folks say they enjoy their work

yy% of them report similar characteristics within their work situation: the recipes for flow

zz% of folks reboot their careers before 40

### The Inside View

I torched my career, gave up, and retired with nothing at 33 years young.

I love to work on what I care about.

I can find others who work on what I/we care about.
