- I must consolidate a few things
    - [[COLORS]]
        - dynamic color adjustment works much better with some root hues
        - I need a central palette to draw from
    - [[TYPEFACES]]
        - similar for fonts
        - a font from which type can spring
    - [[DOMAINS]
        - Vercel and Sanity can draw much of it together
- And this can be one of the boons of [[Roam]]
- I'm struggling hard to finish this [[Nameless]] app because I can't get it to show the result of the toss.
    - The data seems to save, but it doesn't trigger the Grid>ChangeNode>HexaCard component to notice that a new Change has become active. I'm not sure how to get the component to notice. Maybe nextTick is the answer.
