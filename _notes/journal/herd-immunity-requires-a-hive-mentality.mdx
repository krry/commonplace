# Herd immunity requires a hive mentality

Perhaps balance lies somewhere on the more distant horizon than we as individuals might like, just as the hazard of a life-threatening contagion sits a bit too close for comfort for us as individuals.

I'm left wondering how vaccines are considered by those who have long culturally been members of the hive mind.

Vaccine makers insist that we believe in tiny corpuscles of filled with harbingers of respiratory doom encoded as ribonucleic acid.

They insist that we accept the cell, and the double helix, and the genome as truths. Yet if we know one thing of science, it is that these truths are not long-lived.

Just as we built a telescope that could see to the edges of the known universe, we discovered that its edges were fleeing our sight, and that the cosmos as a whole behaves as though it is composed mostly (93%) of unknown substances, dark energy and dark matter.

Do we dare to place the blame for the illness of many of our elders on an undetectable (and often misdetected) microbe, when it could easily by mass, chronic fatigue, guilt, fear, shame, and spite that are the truly pandemic maladies? Could it not be [[The Hurry]] that lays waste to us and our earth? That Unofficial Ubiquitous Rush that has us torching the jungle to plant fields of high fructose corn? That Need for Speed that has xx% of our school children taking amphetamines, yy% of our millennials riddled with cannabinoids, almost everyone jammed full of caffeine and alcohol to bring them back down, and hardly anyone getting a proper night's sleep as we light up the night with screens and parking lot beams and kiss the stars goodbye.
