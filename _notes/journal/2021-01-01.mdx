# 2020-01-01

- A new year begins. How momentous.
    - 2020 could have been better, clearer, easier, more active.
    - Fear was the operative game.
    - I can't say I felt more fearful last year than others, but I witnessed the effects of widespread fear all around me, and I certainly felt the secondhand fear.
