- Today I'm revisiting my workspace for the first time since Zephyr's birth.
- I'm noticing that I forgot some commands for the CLI, and want to prevent that leakage in the future
  - So I'm going to start keeping track of helpful stuff in [cheatsheets]([[cheatsheet]]) here in my [[second brain]]
  - starting with [[Terminal Cheatsheet]]
