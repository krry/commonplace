# Journal Entry, Friday, March 05, 2021

So cool. It worked. Now I can jump in here, hit opt-d for today's new entry and off to the races.

Today I'll focus on beginning to keep an effective [[Commonplace Book]] or [[Zettelkasten]]:

- Tiago Forte offers us a battle-tested [[second brain]] system which I'll summarize as I digest.
- Maggie Appleton shares [her illustrated summary of this system](https://maggieappleton.com/basb), which is lovely.
  - For example, ![How to Approach Content with a Second Brain by Tiago Forte by Maggie Appleton](/images/2021-03-05-10-16-02.png)
  - Or this, from [WTF is an API?](https://maggieappleton.com/api), ![](/images/2021-03-05-10-43-55.png)
