# Journal, pandemic fulcrum toward the Great Relax

- Nearing the end of Feb. This has been quite a month.
    - The birth of our firstborn son [[Zephyr Bear]]
    - [[After the fulcrum of the pandemic begins the Great Relax]].
- I'm now thinking of writing a new narrative, weaving together [[The Well of Being]] with modern events to offer folks a tale of extradimensional paraconspiracy
    - An offhand suggestion on Reddit's /r/keepwriting recently: write two novels, let them differ in ways you can't decide between, let them become two books, or maybe even weave them into one story
        - I'm going to take this advice and JUST START WRITING, letting the hyperlinks of Roam help me pull things together once I have a critical mass
    - So first I'll dig out my post-it notes and catalog them here so I can draw on that story as I begin. There is much I want to avoid forgetting.
