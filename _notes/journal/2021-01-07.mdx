- Ack, what a day of codez..
- I moved all my deploy apps from the hobby account with Vercel to my Atma team account.
- This went smoothly and was a lot.
- Now I have a lot of web apps deployed, which is a lot to maintain:
    - [Nameless](https://nameless.atmanaut.us) - divination
    - [Easeness](https://easeness.biz) - business commentary
    - [Atmanaut.me](https://atmanaut.me) - musings and such
    - [Atmanautica.com](https://atmanautica.com) - folio and playground
    - [Atmanaut.us](https://atmanaut.us) - the hub for hobbies
    - [OG-Image.atmanaut.us](https://og-image.atmanaut.us) - social image generator
    - [Sanity Studio](https://atmanautica.sanity.studio) - CMS for some of the above
