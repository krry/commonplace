Been drinking again
and am told I'll be a father soon
and have no job, no income
I rely on the generosity of others
I trust that all is well
because the bottom recedes as I near it
and each day begins anew
top of the stack
fresh off the docket
past growing foggy
future getting dark
now is the only time
to be ok
to feel…
joy…,
this persistent thirst for
what, booze? love?

why do I climb into the bottle
whenever the opportunity presents
its pimpled rectum?

Will we share any of this drivel? Who could appreciate such futile turmoil?
