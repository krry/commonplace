- Perhaps I can write a story about the myths taking over.
    - A world with no cabal, no sneaky lurkers, no hidden agendas, just mass ignorance and poor communication.
    - Or I could write my own story, not Charles' narrative.
- My story is called [[The Well of Being]]
    - It spans at least ten dimensions and tells the story of being and non-being in three grand acts/eons of evolution.
    - There be crystalline giants, goatherds, whirling dervishes
