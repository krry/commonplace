- oh boy, fresh cuts in the wee hours again
- today I fixed and then polished [[Easeness]] all day
    - it looks like [this now](https://easeness.biz)
    - it's fast, it does color gradients, dark mode, light mode, daaaaaaamn!
    - and I can write for it in [[Sanity]], which isn't quite Roam, but it's a good look
