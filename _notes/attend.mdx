# Attend

The second step in the [[fair-method]] method. Once I have forgotten, my thirst for being renewed, I connect with my senses, and try to dissolve the filters of perception. What I glean and grok and ken, I record here.

- [[get-real]]
- [[full-smile]]
- [[atmanaut]]
- [[sovereignty]]

- And even some half-baked stories, like:
  - [[atman]]
  - [[chapter-1-flying]]
  - [[clotho-rewoven]]
  - [[sissy-no-fuss-ep-1]]

Previous I called this section Areas, following the second tier of [[para-method]]. These are important but not time-sensitive pursuits. I keep notes about my areas of responsibility and pointed interest, even some that don't map tightly to what I [[intend]] (but not many, less and less).
