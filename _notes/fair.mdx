# The FAIR Method

As the person (Tolstoy?) says, "All is fair in love and war."
This is the root process of [[samsara]], and a handy acronym to recall how my commonplace is organized.

**F**orget **A**ttend **I**ntend **R**emember

First, we [[forget]], for [[ignorance]] is [[bliss]].
Next, we [[attend]], [[noticing-or-imagining]] what is or what could be.
Then, we [[intend]], with [[love-or-fear]].
At last, we [[remember]] who we are and why we came.
