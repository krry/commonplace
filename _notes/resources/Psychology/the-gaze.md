# The Gazers are Present

One morning not long ago a dear friend and I came upon a table with two chairs set across from each other. No one else was in sight. There was a plaque to the side of the table facing out.
To editorially paraphrase, it read:

    Two take a seat.
    They lock eyes.
    They speak no words.
    They see each other.

We can probably trace this interactive installation to [_The Artist is Present_](http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/964?locale=en), Marina Abramovic's 736-hour silently seated exhibition at MoMA in 2010. Weeks prior [a documentary about Abramovic](http://marinafilm.com/) had deeply inspired me and led me to study her catalog of work intently, so I immediately sat down at the table and asked my confidante to join me. We sat, and we gazed.

## These two shall dance.

Her face began a subtle dance. Micro-expressions sparked like lightning bugs at twilight. Her left eyebrow peaked. Her lips tightened into a grin ever so slightly. Her eyes entered a soft, slow blink. Her nostrils flared mindfully as she gently inhaled.

My face responded in kind, quasi-involuntarily. I acknowledged my thoughts, and let them pass. I breathed and gazed into her eyes, letting my micro-expressions complement hers, alternating between initiating steps in the dance and responding to her steps.

Before we sat down, we had known that our two minds interplayed gracefully. Now we sat, gazed, breathed together, and illustrated this interplay on our faces. Much was said without a word spoken. To my mind, we came to see each other more truly, to know each other on a new level or plane.

After about ten minutes, I finally broke under a weighty sandbag of mounting vulnerability, embarrassment, and a sneaking sense of absurdity. I glanced away to the left, to the horizon, cracked a smile, and slowly gathered my wits. These had been a powerful, poignant ten minutes.

## Read your fortune in their lookin' balls.

As we strolled away from that fateful table, I imagined participating in this practice with a litany of people I hold dear. "What would it be like with a parent or sibling? With an old friend? With a former lover? With a total stranger? With your boss? With a job applicant? With a new acquaintance?"

Since that first gaze, I have not had the opportunity to repeat this practice with many people. Many are initially trepidatious, some are entirely unwilling, others are willing but the environment doesn't lend itself to an attempt. From my limited experience though, sharing an extended silent gaze tends to give two individuals enough space to acknowledge and exchange some of the truths about their relationship that they otherwise might avoid mentioning.

Here's my theory: you can see someone better without your eyes. There are many facets to an individual, and many dimensions to a relationship between two individuals. Most of these are non-visual. By locking eyes, remaining silent, and giving pause, two can open their minds' eyes to this multitude of other facets and dimensions. By gazing they strip away the words, the activity, the dance, and can come to really **see** each other and how they relate to each other. They share the present mindfully. Minds meld. Spock would be proud.

P.S. A fair warning: this is powerful stuff. Use it sparingly. Or don't, I'm no expert.
