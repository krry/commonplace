# Test For An Empty Object In Javascript

I can't imagine remembering this rote. Thankfully there are more forward thinking devs than I, like [@flaviocopes](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-check-empty-object/)...

```javascript
const obj = {}

Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object
```
