# Principles of Zen Design
The Shibumi Seven

*koko*
:	austerity
: refraining from adding what is not absolutely necessary in the first place
: the final product has the simplicity of the initial concept

*kanso*
: simplicity
: eliminate what doesn't matter to make more room for what does
: avoid ornaments

*shizen*
: naturalness
: incorporate naturally occurring patterns and rhythms into your design
: resemble nature deliberately and subtly

*yugen*
: subtlety
: limit information just enough to pique curiosity and leave something to the imagination
: the pledge, the turn, but not [the prestige](http://davidgrobertson.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/the-prestige-magic-tricks-and-fiction/)

*fukinsei*
: imperfection, asymmetry
: leave room for others to cocreate with you; provide a platform for open innovation
: craft a user-shaped hollow into your product

*datsuzoku*
:	break from routine
:	an interruptive "break" is an important part of any breakthrough design
: shock the user out of inertia to help them create meaningful change

*seijaku*
: stillness, tranquility
: doing something isn't always better than doing nothing
: beware of noise, for it carries information without meaning
