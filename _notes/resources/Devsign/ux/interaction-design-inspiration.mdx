\f0\fs26 \cf2 The viral growth rate, or \'93K-factor,\'94 is the accepted way to measure the virality of a product. It\'92s computed by multiplying the percentage of current users who invite other people (X), the average number of people who are invited per user (Y), and the percentage of invited people who accept an invitation (Z). Many companies use this \'96- and only this \'97 to determine the success of a product.\
\
There are two primary reasons why tracking retention is important for any business. The first is the fact that it will not only improve the K-factor, but it will also make virality itself last longer. The second is that it\'92s a great way to measure the overall sustainability of a product. Even if you don\'92t have high virality, a sustainable business will last.	}
