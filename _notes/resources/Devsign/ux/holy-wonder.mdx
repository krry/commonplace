I hadn't seen this article on the dubiously invaluable novelty of sliced bread.

But it got me thinking. What else is a better thing since sliced bread?  Interestingly, I think we can group In-n-Out Burger, bikinis, condoms, flip-flops, and Grey Poupon into that set.

Let's stop and think about the true value of sliced bread for a moment. I posit that it really doesn’t functionally add much utility to people's lives or save them much time or money. Probably less than a fraction of a percent of their yearly income when all is computed out. Could become such a symbol of novel efficiency, what could solar power become?

tl;dr already—I know.  But let me expound anyway. The hard truth is that a loaf of sliced bread isn't cool or valuable when it's compared to a whole loaf.  For a well-off person today that makes $20 per hour, it's worth 67¢ more than unsliced bread.  It takes a generous two minutes to slice and bag a loaf of bread.  Two minutes of that well-off person's time would cost them 67¢ if not invested in gainful employment, so the opportunity cost of sliced bread is under a dollar for most folks. Back then the added value must have been reduced even further given that automatic bread-slicing machines were much less sophisticated and "buggy" than they are today. In fact, it's likely that sliced bread cost considerably more than unsliced loaves for the first several years of its existence.

Holy Gourd!  It must have been the marketing, the advertising, that made "the best thing since sliced bread" a household expression and "sliced bread" a household good.  Someone pulled the wheaty wool over our eyes and force-fed us Wonder Bread until we reached epidemic levels of colon cancer.  Sliced bread tasted worse.  It was and is nutritionally worse.  Plus bread isn't even good for people compared to most foods. (See also gluten, Crohn's disease, dietary inflammation, and "Wheat Belly".)  It's made mainly of grass seed which our digestive tracts aren't meant to or capable of handling well.  Even mako sharks don't eat grass.

But I digress.  Since we now can, let's subject to the fire of the sun the common practices of the human peon.  These include eating grass made tasty (wheat and other grains), getting energy from burning things (plugging in), and burning things to move (motor city).  Are we humans or Hutts (yes, like Jabba)?

The simile only goes so far. Sliced bread doesn't offer us real, tangible, long-term value.  Solar power does: sustainable survival on Earth. Sliced bread was invented with the laziest of the bread-hungry consumers in mind; PV systems were invented with the Sun in mind.  Some bread eating folks after 1928 likely couldn't afford a knife to cut tough bread into slices for sandwiches.  My heart goes back in time and out to them for they were unique in that sliced bread was the best thing since sliced bread.  For everyone else, this has likely been false.
