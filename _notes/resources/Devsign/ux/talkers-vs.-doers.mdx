I just found this passage copied below, which I wrote in February of this year. 2012 was not a year of doing, however.  My frustration at Disney had not yet set in.  I was actively designing new products and pouring myself into company-wide blue-sky tech initiatives at the time, hoping the big fish would bite on a product. No such luck. No bites. Left Disney in September, three days after my birthday. And I still haven't built any of the side projects that I came up with during the period in which I was steadily and continually thwarted by the Yahoos in charge.

You can see bits of my growing frustration at the talkers already in the passage below. You can also see that I was headed toward constructive work, but still talking about it instead of doing it. As I'm doing now.

"I'm more of a doer these days. Law school pretty much talked me out. After five minutes of most discussions, I begin to worry that we're approaching the matter all wrong—no matter the matter. If phone conversations with distant friends don't quickly resolve into plans to convene, I lose interest, unless held rapt by stories of recent experiences. Sit me on a plane next to somebody and I'll try to start a new project with them. Anything to start building. Or I'll quietly scratch in my Moleskine, trying to come up with something on my own. But I wasn't always this way.

2010 was a 90-hour-per-week waterslide from talker to doer. And 2011 saw even more making, and even less talking. This is not to say I've become antisocial, though perhaps nearer to it. It is only to say that one's preference for talking is inversely proportional to one's preference for making. If a given individual—say, Jerry Seinfeld—finds himself with a strong propensity for talking, he likely possesses proportionally less desire to make things. Likewise, some strongly prefer making to talking. Take, for example, Daniel Plainview of _Oil!_ and _There Will Be Blood_. He'll "drink up your milkshake" before he'll shake your hand and dispense any pleasantries. There is simply only so much time in a day, and only so many days in our lives. And as our understanding of that scarcity develops, we all pitch and repitch our tents somewhere between talkerville and makertown.

A talker in its pure form prefers to debate the pros and cons of a decision, regale you with a tale of staggering minutiae, or pitter-patter around the heart of an issue until it falls through the musty old floorboards into the apartment below, where hopefully a doer lives who can fix the mess. A true doer on the other hand, prefers to nail that issue down, dissemble it, clean each part, and reassemble it; often a doer will even invent a problem when none is readily apparent.

So I could be hanging out with my pals right now, spouting off, getting nowhere, building nothing. Instead, I'm going to try to reduce my recent experiences into something useful, something that might save others pain, or lend them a chuckle."
