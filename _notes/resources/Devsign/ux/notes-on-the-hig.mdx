# Notes on the HIG
## [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/[[documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig]]/)
### Platform
#### Display
* Minimum touchable size (44x44 px)Pixels are units of image space, points are units of screen space. E.g., on a Retina display 2 px = 1 pt.
* On iPhone, launch in upright portrait. On iPad, launch in current orientation.

#### Settings/Preferences
* Settings app is for one time set-and-forget preferences.

#### Gesture-based Control
* Use gestures like default apps.
* Avoid trying to train users (on new gestures) unless absolutely necessary.

### Human Interface Principles
#### Aesthetic Integrity
* Aesthetic continuum: Productivity <==================> Immersion

#### Consistency
* Exercise external consistency with iOS standards, and internal consistency within the app.

#### Direct manipulation
* Use the interface to abstract the user from the information architecture and processing, not from the objects themselves.

#### Feedback
* Give immediate feedback to brief inputs
* Give status updates during longer inputs
* Graphics are the primary feedback channel.
* Sound is a secondary feedback channel.
* Vibration is a tertiary feedback channel.

#### Metaphors
* Use metaphors to real objects and actions to make virtual objects and actions more intuitive.
* Use a metaphor sparingly as a reference, not deeply as a complete structural or functional map

#### User Control
* Allow the user to retain control.
* Recommend appealing courses of action.
* Recommend against dangerous actions.
* Expected controls include:
** Cancel before operation starts
** Cancel gracefully during operation
** Confirm destructive actions

### App Design Strategy
#### App Definition Statement
1. List features
2. Identify audience characteristics
3. Filter features through audience
4. Define your app
