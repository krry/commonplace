# Snowpiercer - Ship it perpetually

Snowpiercer, as you know, is the last hope of humanity. It is a perpetual motion machine, circling the Earth with its precious cargo: techies. These techies—the last vestiges of humanity—are carefully placed within Snowpiercer at their allotted stations, occupying their particular, preordained positions, performing their discrete duties.

Snowpiercer didn't just materialize though. When that long winter came, some of us were ready. Some were left frozen, but I and mine weathered the storm. If you're interested as to how, let's talk equipment. My survival shed was piled high with [`git flow`](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow), brimming with BDD and CI, and chockfull of feedback loops to wile away the lonely nights.

But you're never alone on Snowpiercer. Among the personnel on this fatal rail we have:

1. designers
2. producers
3. directors
4. architects
5. coordinators
6. developers
7. engineers
8. testers
9. analysts
10. users

## 1. As a designer, I envision the product.

## 2. As a producer, I have the resources to make the product.

## 3. As a director, I keep the train on the tracks.

## 4. As an architect, I realize the product.

## 5. As a coordinator, I connect the cars.

## 6. As a developer, I build the product.

## 7. As an engineer, I ensure we go as fast as possible without running off the rails.

## 8. As a tester, I'm okay with failure as long as I detect it before you.

## 9. As an analyst, I knowish what you've been up to, to a point, in my acerbic way.

## 10. As a user, I love gelatin made of roaches, and I would have never known the difference.

Developer, yours is a simple station. In come the tickets requesting features, out go the commits. But it's never quite that easy, is it? On Snowpiercer it can be.

If the designer and director have performed their duties, the tickets are shimmering beacons of clarity and wisdom—a joy to read, and a pleasure to complete. Your role as a developer is to build the new features as specified, and to support them with tests that verify their operation and completion.

For each requested feature, you:

1. Branch `develop`, naming the new branch succinctly after the feature, e.g., `git flow feature start devsample` which is roughly equivalent to `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop && git branch feature/devsample`.
2. Write unit, functional, and/or integration tests that comprehensively describe the new feature.
3. Develop the feature, committing your progress as each test passes.
4. When the feature is complete, publish it to Github.
5. Submit a pull request for your feature branch into `develop`.
6. Ask the most relevant other dev in your pod for a code review of that pull request.
7. Field the reviewers comments and feedback, committing and publishing updates to the feature if necessary.
8. When the feature is approved, rebase your branch on `develop`, then merge your branch into `develop`. Feature finished!

## 7. As an engineer, I release and refine the product.

Engineer, you ensure that Snowpiercer keeps running smoothly and perpetually. A perpetual motion machine is still a machine after all. This machine, like any other, needs monitoring, maintenance, tuning, and refinement to keep running. These are your duties.

Once the developer has finished a set of features, and the director and coordinator have grouped the features into a coherent release that offers new and verifiable value to the users, your task begins.

For each slated release, you:

1. Verify with the director, the coordinator, and the developer that the set of features to be released is represented in the `develop` branch. A properly attended task manager will automate this step.
2. Branch `develop`, naming the new release branch after the release, e.g., `git flow release start new-release-on-life` which is equivalent to `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop && git branch release/new-release-on-life`

## 8. As a tester, I simulate multitudes of users to predict

## 9. As an analyst, I measure the product and its fit in the market.

## 10. As a user, I need the product.
