Once a business goal has been defined, the first step in the UX design process is to identify the target users. So when Ericson and I seek to apply our design process to introduce a consistent, branded look and feel to the company's software products, we first must ask: "Who will use these products?" There are many ways to slice the overall user base of our software, but the most distinct and polarizing factor is whether a user is a customer or an employee, whether the software is internal- or external-facing.

Most aspects of our designs and development will hinge on this factor: branding and voice, ease of use, security, practicality, device and browser support, deployment process, even the tech stacks. So when we set out to establish some standards, it will greatly speed the process to group our front-ends by whether they serve customers or not.

Here's the distribution of our software front-ends by pre-/post-sale and then again by internal-/external-facing.

Good Morning, SolarCity!

The time is unimportant and the weather is sunny with a chance of otherwise. And at this auspicious moment, Ericson and I are tickled to reintroduce ourselves as the newly minted (but long-rumored) User Experience Team.

UX is a younger field than most, but its meatspace analog—hospitality—is one of the world's oldest professions.

Many leading consumer product and service companies have recently discovered the importance of user-centered design and user advocacy; it's the very core of Apple, and they seem to be doing well.

Even many older, non-digital companies are experiencing rebirth as they invest in new-fangled UX. As they surf through user flows and pour over personas, looking at their business five-dimensionally* for the first time in years, they see the glaring misnomers, inconsistencies and inefficiencies that infiltrate their products and processes over time and for lack of user advocacy. Wearing the user's lens reminds many of them why they got into the business to begin with: to make other people happier.

Ericson and I have a combined 20 years of experience in UX, so to us it's old hat.
