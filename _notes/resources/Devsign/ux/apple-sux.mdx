I've been very pleased with my iPhone 5 until about minus one week of one year since I got it.  Scratch-free (I'm diligent), dent-free (dexterous), mar-free(defensive), problem-free (UXcellent). Then the power button—with which I use to sleep the display and wake it—stopped responding to the usual pressure.  So I increased the pressure. It yielded, occasionally, and with less enthusiasm. These days I'm lucky to swoon my phone once out of ten tries.  It's grown impervious to my index fingering charm. What shall I do?

It's 1 year+days old.

Planned obselescence?  It's nothing quite so indisidious, I surely hope. More nearly a coincidental hardware failure in spite of gentle, conscientious usage.

Sounds too friendly to be profitable...

*Update: Two friends have attested to experiencing the same power button failure within the last week.*
