# Marissa Mayer's 3 Rules of App Design
* The Two Tap Rule — "Once you're in the app, is it two taps to do anything you want to do? If no, time to redesign the app."
* The 5-Point Rule — Count one point for every different font, font size, and color on a page. If a page goes above five points, it's time to redesign.
* The 98% Rule — Every product should be designed for the way it will be used 98% of the time.
