5.5 Habits of Successful Designers
1. They know when to quit.
2. They redesign processes.  Highly effective designers embrace and learn processes — and then tweak them to work well in reality
3. They combat distortions of reality, especially prevailing clichés that paint design as subjective, trumped by data or logic, improved with more feedback, etc.
4. They find the right environment, demarcated by brains, passion, trust, and courage.
5. They habitually rewrite the habits.  Highly effective designers roll with the times.

Design myths to debunk
- the fold is not real, lead the user to scroll
- standard fonts are not a limit to observe, go for readability at all costs, adjust line height to double if possible
- you cannot design an effective website before the content it is to bear is available

Design is not subjective
We need to wrap our minds around a new definition of design that builds upon better evidence. Taking talent for granted, the definition lies somewhere between three key points: Edwards' assertion that artists have a trained ability to represent the world as audiences desire to see them, Gigerenzer's assertion that intuition and gut feelings are better suited for certain types of problem-solving and Gladwell's assertion that expertise in a trade is achieved at the magical 10,000 hour mark.

In simpler words, the practice of design occurs at the confluence of talent, training,intuition and experience. The rest is just background noise.

In a sense, you could say that the brilliance of a good designer is not defined by her ability to represent the world as she sees it, but by her trained ability to represent it as others expect to see it.

For a design process to produce an extraordinary product, two conditions must be met: stakeholders and participants must unequivocally accept that they aren't designers, and trust the real designers' abilities.w
