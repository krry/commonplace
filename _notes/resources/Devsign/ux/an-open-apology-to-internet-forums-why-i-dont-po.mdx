# An Open Apology To Internet Forums Why I Dont PoAn Open Apology to Internet Forums

(part 1 of 3) To the guys with all the answers...

Dear Forumgoer,

I don't post. And I'm very sorry.

I suppose that's a bit of an oversimplification. I do post: I tweet regularly, write an occasional status update on Facebook or Google+. And I've started and sunsetted about half a dozen blogs on as many platforms: Spyder Web on Blogspot, Terrasitic Paraforms on Blogspot and later Blogger, A New Leaf on Wordpress, SeenMy, then Obsidian Opinion on Tumblr then ported to Posterous, among others. None of these are really worth mentioning or checking out, other than as expository evidence of the theme of this missive. Despite all of my shameless attempts, I have never been able to assemble a significant audience. Worse than failing to satisfy my vanity, I haven't even been able to foster the enriching discussions I envisioned each time I set up a new blog. Tallying up all the time I've spent trying and failing to make a substantial contribution to the fabric of the web leaves me a bit morose. Even still, I'm currently spinning up some new projects, coming soon to krry.me and uxioms.com.

Beyond my futile attempts at blogging, I've contributed to a handful of wikipedia articles, and asked and answered a few questions on Quora. Not much else. I couldn't begin to tell you how many forums I've combed for answers to everyday problems. Thousands of hours spent on thousands of sites. And yet I've never posted. Even when I've found precisely the solution I needed after hours of searching. Instead of capturing my elation in the form of a quick "thx" or a corroborating anecdote that might help the next guy with the same problem, my conditioned response is to close that tab of my browser. That's pretty shitty of me, right?

Before I go any further, I'd like to send out a long-overdue thank you to all the wonderful forumgoers that have toiled away on the message boards and forums which eventually contained the answers to my problems. You did what I could not tolerate to do, and I have reaped enormous time savings from you. I cannot comprehend switching places with you. From my perspective, you are sad, misguided suckers. But I wouldn't have it any other way, and for that I'm deeply sorry.

It feels great to get that off my chest. And while I don't expect you to accept my apology, I hope I can someday make it up to you.

In fact, I'm going to start right away. And you'll be shaking your heads with righteous disdain at what I've come up with in parts 2 and 3 of my apology.

Until then,
Kerry

Why I Don't Post

Without going fully infographic on you, I think I can illustrate some of the main obstacles users face when trying to contribute to the mud-bricked troll castles of Forumville.

1. Signup Gates: To post I must sign up. I attempted this Herculean feat on the first forum that demanded it, and the memory of it stills haunts me. I've documented the steps in a harrowing piece I like to call, "Wish I Could Tell You How To..." (images screencapped and annotated)

2. Anonymity: While I may be complicit already by seeking advice from ostensibly knowledgeable strangers, the utility of the pseudonymous/anonymous online identity reached its murky zenith in the mid '90s. These days its main function is to estrange or weird out potential new participants in online communities by fostering snark and faceless anger.

3. Basic usability issues - Allow me to comma-delimit my gripes so as not to beleaguer or encrypt the point: threads, threads in frames, subthreads, scrolling, amateurish categories, word soup interfaces, advertisements out the wazoo, dropdowns that look like links, links that look like dropdowns, windows 95 themes, small fonts with no sense of readability, multiple navigational hierarchies, mistakeless error messages, miserrorless take messages, messless taker ages, takemess agelessages, errorage misslessmistakerages, etc. Like an old set of Christmas lights, many forums are too tangled to salvage.

4. Wilting Garden - Regardless of the usefulness of the information I obtain there, the forum itself often seems to be in ruins. The page layouts often break in modern browsers, unnecessary copies of replied-to posts bloat threads with stammering redundancy, and the lack of infrastructure or architecture leaves forumgoers to create rooms with custom rules to satisfy the community's needs. Forums are the types of houses where you don't even bother asking if you should take your shoes off. No one's really in charge, but some guy in an Everlast sweatshirt covered in pizza stains is bellowing "Bump! BUMP!" This does not inspire one to invest one's unique knowledge there. Ruins tend to stay in ruins, until a (new) civilization comes along and sets up camp.

5. No semblance of reciprocity - The quid pro quo of participating in forums is very difficult to root out. One might ask, "What am I really doing by contributing to this forum?" In my opinion, you're essentially pinning a note to the wall of a ramshackle community center, putting a fake name on it, and hoping someone will appreciate it.

6. Mods are the house trolls... and trolls beget trolls. 'nough said.

The Solution - A New Platform... for Parties!

1. Sign up after posting through several OAuth 2.0 options, or in two easy steps: we know your email since you arrived by invitation, so just pick a password, and optionally a username. Uniqueness is fostered by making your identity more than a single string of characters. Our usernames have color and motion, typefaces, your faces, your locations and whatever identifying information you wish to make available. If you reach a level of participation in our communities where you're valued for your unique contributions, we may revisit your username, and grant you a unique one.
2. Real identity or at least real, consistent reputation
3. Participation is tracked and rewarded across all communities.
4. You're specifically invited to participate, and the group benefits by your activity or suffers without it.
5. Earn points, unlock special features, gain reputation and status, win prizes
6. Every participant has democratic policing tools to get the communities in line. If the party fouls don't keep things running smoothly, the bouncer will.
7. Trolls don't like the light, so we relegate them to their own troll communities in safe, dark anonymous pits. No more living under bridges charging troll tolls.
