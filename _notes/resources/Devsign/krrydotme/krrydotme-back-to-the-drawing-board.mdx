# krry.me - back to the drawing board

I've reached a sticking point with the static portal/portfolio app I was putting together for krry.me. The templates are too static. I haven't been able to animate partial changes like I had hoped, and the pushStates aren't rich enough to ensure that my visitors will see what they expect to when visiting different `/paths`.

So let's start over. Let's do this the smart way. The way I would tell someone else to do. Follow the protocol, dumbass!

## 1. Goals - I want a site:
* with my name on it
* that links to my various web presences
* that is easy to update with new projects
* that features some of my old projects
* that looks cool and has some whimsy
* that keeps me working on open source projects

## 2. Tech - I want to:
* wait until resources have loaded, then reveal them gracefully
* link to any state in the app with a url
* populate the app with real data from APIs
* display stuff I've recently liked around the web
* ask first time visitors to customize some things
* remember visitors' customizations when they return
* animate state transition and view/state changes

## 3. Content - I'll show:
* pictures and screenshots of my work
* code snippets for the fancy bits
* stuff I've written
* things I like or review
* photos I've taken
* ways to contact me

# Getting down to it

I'm thinking one way to frame this project is as a portal/portfolio that could apply to any person, whether an individual human being or an organization that has corporate personhood in the eyes of the law. Perhaps I'm really devsigning a white label marketing site? What elements would that sort of a site have?

* logo
* slogan
* products
* ambitions
* opinions
* culture
* allies
* contact

These apply nicely to my personal goals for krry.me. I suspect that sites like [about.me] have thought about this quite a bit. Time for some research… … Yes, yes they have. I could spend time customizing the crap out of their product, or continuing learning as I write my own. Let's not get too grand about this concept yet, but tactical and fun.

## 1. Logo

I'll draw one when I'm feeling inspired to.

## 2. Slogan

This could function as the home page message. Even better if it coincides with the navigation and main sections of the site. Brainstorm time!
