This silly place is the result of a labor of love, but really not all that much work. It's a safe place I've made to test out some responsive navigation layouts and transitions, and play with some randomized animations. Nothing too intense, mostly design explorations. After my last year's deep mechanical dives into build systems, deployment strategy, and release cycles, it was time to return to aesthetics.

If you're interested in the design effort that went into this little corner of the web, visit here from different devices. I've done what I can to offer a pleasant, navigable experience from any terminal: hand-held, desk-topped, or wall-mounted. Try it from your phone, save it to your homescreen, hit it from your smart TV. I'm aiming for a universally slick, adaptive experience, so if you encounter any rough edges
