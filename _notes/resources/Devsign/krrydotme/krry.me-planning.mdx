## WORK: MY PAST WORK

My work as an experience designer and developer takes on many forms, the most _developed_ of which is a production grade web application. The less developed forms are all of the conceptual, processional, programmatic, systematic, documental, sketchy types of work product you might expect from someone in UI/UX or product management: user flows, workflows, tech audits, API designs, interface mockups, product roadmaps, feature/release plans, and so on.

But I've done lots of other stuff too. I hope you won't mind if I toot my own horn a bit (this is my site after all :)

- I built a lead entry app from scratch to replace the paper forms our field sales agents were still using. It's now used companywide and has been ported several times.
- I mapped out development, hosting, and deployment processes for our larger new projects, standardizing a `git` flow and a weekly release cycle that kept us moving and stable. We integrated this with a Jira issue tracking, Jenkins automation, and some `git` hooks which automatically pulled reviewed and approved feature sets to our hierarchy of quality-assured Heroku instances. It was slick, **shipping it** had never been so easy.
- I got us going on Slack when it had just launched. And my custom hubot (`raybot`) was able to join us. Growing our internal Slack community from one to hundreds took mere months. And `raybot` did its job delighting our Slackers with useful automation and measured doses of whimsy and serendipity.
- I spun up self-hosted Discourse instances to foster broader discussions among customers, designers, builders and stakeholders. Discourse is a very promising community platform; I hope to explore it further.
- I put together a simple node app where we could securely publish our notes and product documents. Team members previously relied on email attachments which kept getting lost in jumbled threads. Then along came Confluence (blech!) and Slack (hurray!).
- I built four successive, bodyless prototypes of a new sign up flow for SolarCity customers. The last one convinced our founders to pursue online sales, which then became the prime directive for the marketing, sales, and software teams. The result was [Go!](http://go.solarcity.com) which you can peruse yourself, or check out my extensive walkthrough of its fruition.
