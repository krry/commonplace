title: Like A Pole Axed Steer
---
# Like A Pole Axed SteerWhile resting my bones in Missoula after a long day of riding, I overheard a new (to me) expression on a show about real-life pirates. "He went down like a poleaxed steer."
> The collapse of western culture is blatantly obvious, all the way from the totally sold out whores at the top of the pyramid to the peons at the bottom. People are going through the motions of their life like poleaxed steers.

[Trail and Camp-fire: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club](http://books.google.com/books?id=Z09DAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA232&dq=like+a+poleaxed+steer&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2F33U67ZOYmkigLgpoHYDw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=like%20a%20poleaxed%20steer&f=false) by George Bird Grinnell uses the expression in 1897 when writing about a grizzly bear he had shot between the eyes.
> On another occasion, in a windfall, I got up within eight or ten feet of a grizzly which simply bolted off paying no heed to a hurried shot which I delivered as I poised unsteadily on the swaying top of an overthrown dead pine On yet another occasion when I roused a big bear from his sleep he at the first moment seemed to pay little or no heed to me and then turned toward me in a leisurely way the only sign of hostility he betrayed being to ruffle up the hair on his shoulders and the back of his neck I hit him square between the eyes and he dropped like a pole axed steer
