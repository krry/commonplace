Backyard Camping

write convocation on: why camping is beneficial to all children?...

Standing on the deck you heard the sounds of birds at dawn and wondered at the familiarity of your surroundings.

Camping, it occurred to you, allowed the comfortable feeling you experienced. How many mornings did you awaken and feel nature pouring in?  Enough..? Apparently

As the sounds of dawn in this backyard forest make your infantile and futile feelings of nostalgic childhood rise like a phoenix from a close call to reincarnation.

All  ways  second  place.

Or die...Just like the phoenix, your ultimate goal is self-destruction, not self-actualization.  You don't even know where you are.  But you fly, maps be damned. Enjoy the flight tray tables up dick in the upright positions.  What was I thinking?
