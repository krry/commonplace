# A Hierarchy of Reaction

evokes [[integrated-information-theory]]

An old textbook from my high school biology days defined life as something that responds to a stimulus. I'll have to dig into the recent literature on this topic. Surely we have made some progress on this front. Some recent personal revelations have developed my perspective on the definition of life.

Sometimes I feel that rocks or stones are living. Sometimes I see all matter as living, and the energy flowing among this matter as just as alive. Does all matter respond to stimulus? Does all energy? Is the conversion of matter to energy or vice versa a response, or a reaction? When I strike a rock with another rock, do I witness a response? Perhaps I do. Or perhaps I miss it.

Perhaps I do not observe the struck rock for long enough before and after the strike. Perhaps the transfers of energy between any two particles is enough to elicit a response. It is plausible that we fail to witness many of the responses. If we do not keep watch for long enough, we may fail to observe the response, or its explicit symptoms. If our sensory instruments are not sensitive enough, we could miss the responses as well.

If we can choose to accept this definition of life ("it responds to stimulus"), we can also choose to scrap our other supposed understandings of life as we think we know it. Today I hope to reframe our treatment of life a bit, to give its definition a more subtle hierarchy.

# Black & White or Greyscale

Over the past ten-or-so years I've been continually thrilled to discover how wrong I've been to apply binary labels to natural phenomena. As mathematicians seeking to describe complex systems with series functions, we're taught to first step through the zero case, then the unitary case, and then look for an emerging pattern in the `n` cases beyond wherein a useful sequence or series can be defined.

    0. No things in play.
    1. One thing in play.
    2. Multiple things in play.
    => n.

Sometimes the `n=2` case provides distinct insights toward the behavior of the rest of the series. Other times a **mather** is left tabulating until `n` is untenably large and a pattern still has not exposed its furtive little algebraic ears from the graphite or chalk-dusted turf. The two things we can depend on, though, are the null and the unit.

Applied to a probabilistic distribution rather than a series, the null and the unit case cover a lot more ground. When `p=0`, the probability of the hypothetical event is zero, zip, nil, nada. Taking `p+1` though, we have `p=1`, which means that hypothetical event is certain to occur under any circumstances. Things get pretty black and white when you play with a zero and a one in the probability-verse. A mathematician soon realizes it's quite literally never so cut and dry in nature.

## Living or non-living

First of all, why is this a necessary distinction? We could instead ask, "How living?" A grain of basalt amidst the seashore sand tumbling in the ocean waves impacts and is impacted by many of the other grains in tiny perhaps imperceptible ways, but it is still formed by how it collides with others, how it bounces away.
