# The Me ChMe-mes, the-mes, and teams: My job in short

People are different from other animals because they can make and store sets of directions that help them reach good ends.  Some sets of directions are really good at helping people reach good ends.  The really good ones seem to have lives of their own.  They jump from person to person, helping lots of people reach their good ends.  These sets of directions are known to be pretty full of themselves.  If you come upon them quietly enough, you can sometimes hear them talking to themselves about how great they are.  "Me-me-me-me-me-me", they cry.  We just call them "me-mes" for short.

But me-mes aren't all that.  We, people are able to do two other very important jobs.  The first job? We can make "the-mes." Let me explain...  

As you know we can take the stuff around us and put it together to make things.  This is called "making a the" or "the-making", because the first of this new thing—say it's something we all know well, like a dog shirt—is *the* dog shirt.  *The* only dog shirt, at least for a moment at the very beginning.  One might make the first car, and then say, "This is *the car*."  The "the" is the key here.  We call the new things that people the-make "the-mes".  Few people can make the-mes.  It is very hard.  But then again only people can make the-mes, so at least we have that going for us.  Don't tell the me-mes.  They might turn green.

The second very important job we can do is build me-mes into our the-mes.  If we learn the me-mes well enough, we can break them down into their pieces, and use those pieces as building blocks along with the other stuff when we the-make.  You might think I'm crazy at this point, just making stuff up.  But stick with me, we're almost done.  Sometimes the me-mes really like being part of the-mes we build them into and decide to live in them for good.  Then, when we make things that are repeats of the-mes, the me-mes get repeated too.  The-mes and me-mes form teams.

Teams are my paint and my brush.  I search for the best ones, save them, study them, take them to bits, put them back together,  change their me-mes and their the-mes.  I try to match teams with the people they will help most.  For the teams have no power without people that use them to reach (good) ends.  But most people do not recognize teams, much less the ones that will help them reach good ends the best.  It is my job to change that.

I make teams easy to recognize.  I group them into sets that make sense, and that people will understand as fitting together to do a job or help them reach good ends.  I make groups of teams that make each other easier to learn and put to work.  My new favorite group of teams helps a person keep track of all the little things they do during the day and how they feel.  When a lot of people have started keeping track of how they act and feel, it adds up all of these little things and learns about what acts make people happy.  Then it can tell people how to live happier and better.

What are the teams needed to do this? First we need to be able to write down all of the little things while still having enough time to do all of them.  So we will need a team that takes the me-me of writing down one's acts, and makes it very easy to do and very easy to repeat any place, any time.  People will have to be able to write things down with their hands and their voices, or even better without doing anything.  A good the-me for this team would watch the person and write things down for him or her.
