- Bitcoin is
    - an electronic cryptocurrency
        - made from digital signatures
            - transacted peer-to-peer
            - recorded by a distributed network of nodes
                - using proof-of-work
                    - that is computationally impractical to attack
                        - if the majority of players are honest
                        - and where transactions are easy to verify for any node.
- Proof-of-work
    - a solution to the Two Generals problem
    - Nodes follows the greater majority of (processing) power, which is demonstrated by solving difficult problems faster.
- from the Bitcoin whitepaper [[January 10th, 2018]]:
    - The network flow of transactions and blocks
        - 1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes
            - [[Transactions]] must be publicly announced to eschew a central trusted party.
        - 2. Each node collects new transactions into a block.
            - A block may hold record of an arbitrary number of transactions, depending on the proof-of-work.
        - 3. Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
            - Increment a nonce until the value's hash has x' zero bits.
            - Essentially one CPU, one vote.
        - 4. When a node finds proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
            - Any node can solve a block, but all nodes keep records of the whole chain.
        - 5. Nodes accept the block iff all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
            - the longest chain is used
            - every node validates each block
            - a valid block can be traced back
        - 6. Nodes move on to create a new block with the previous hash.
            - Thus continues the chain of blocks, linked in sequence and in SHA-256 #blockchain
    - A coin is a chain of transactions' digital signatures with proof of work.
    - A new coin is issued to the CPU that solves the next block.
        - this is an incentive to support the network
        - this is how coins are introduced into circulation
        - eventually the coin supply will reach the set limit (ceiling)
    - Transaction fees cover the support effort when new coins do not suffice or arise.
    - Storage will not be an issue thanks to Merkle trees that compress past blocks with a hash.
    - Payments/transactions within Merkle trees can be verified if
        - they are in the longest chain,
        - the transactions can be unhashed, and
        - the subsequent blocks are valid.
