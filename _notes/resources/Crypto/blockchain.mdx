# Blockchain- from [[FN01]]
  - Blockchain is:
    - a growing ledger of transactions
      - contained in blocks
        - which are added to the chain
          - when the proof-of-work is established by a node,
            - often in the form of a [[nonce]] that yields a hash with a set number of leading zeroes when included in the block
            - The difficulty of the proof-of-work is determined by the number of leading zeroes.
  - from the Ethereum Whitepaper
    - 1 üÖ±Ô∏è (big B [[Bitcoin]]) == 1000000 b
    - Ethereum
      - has blockchain assets
      - is [[Turing-complete]]
      - has [[smart contracts]]
      - has state transition functions
    - Chaumian blinding?
    - b-money is created when CPUs or now often faster GPUs solve computational puzzles
    - decentralizing currency combining established primitives for managing ownership through public key cryptography with a consensus algorithm tracking ownership, which is the [[proof of work]], or proof of stake if weighted proportional to currency holdings rather than computational resources
    - coin is roughly unspent transaction output (UTXO)
    - a block comprises:
      - a timestamp
      - a nonce
      - a hash of the previous block
      - a list of all new transactions
    - block solutions take between 10 mins and 2 hrs
    - double SHA-256 hash encryption provides 2^187 permutations which is computationally hard making the blockchain prohibitively laborious to spoof
      - it takes the network 2^69 tries to find a valid block which typically takes 10 mins
      - finding a block grants 25 üÖ±Ô∏è to the miner
    - the longest chain from a fork is followed, because it is true
    - simple payment verification (SPV) looks at the block headers for proof of work then downloads only relevant branches rather than the whole [[blockchain]]
    - [[Ethereum]] allows us to build decentralized applications ([[dapps]]) that are rapid to develop, secure regardless of scale or niche, and able to interact efficiently with other different applications
    - [[Ethereum]] data structure and flow
      - the **State** has **Accounts**
      - an **Account** has:
        - a nonce, which is a counter
        - the current ether **balance**
        - an optional **contract** code
        - optional **storage**
      - a **Contract** has:
        - balance controls
        - key-value store controls
        - essentially adds a control layer around a transaction
      - Owner Accounts make Transactions externally
      - a **Transaction** has:
        - a recipient
        - a sender signature
        - an amount
        - data, optionally
        - starting Gas - the max computational steps allowed
        - Gas price - multiplier per step
      - Gas is roughly a unit of computation
        - what the sender pays the miner = start gas \* gas price
        - then gets a refund for unused gas
      - a Message has:
        - a sender
        - a recipient
        - an amount
        - optional data
        - start gas
        - a Message is sent by contracts to contracts
    - Ethereum block is a subset of the üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin block
      - üÖ±Ô∏è block + transactions list + most recent state + block number + difficulty = E block
      - focused partial history on a Patricia tree which is a modifiable Merkle tree (insert or delete nodes)
    - Applications for Ethereum
      - A token system can pay transaction fees in Ether used to "activate" the meta token accounts.
