# Antiexistential

<!-- Unstuck in spacetime. -->

It doesn't matter what time it is, or where you are. Or if you are. This is not to say nothing matters. Rather, what matters is that we recognize where and when we are, and respond to these circumstances with poise and resolve.

## Cryptobiography

<!-- Write your story everyday. -->

```script
What word do you type more than your password?!
With an engaging algorithm, you'll never have to sign.
(panels that swoop right and curve toward you on a huge building as you rise on the Y at a linear rate)
I thought you said we were going to the top!?
TOP?!
```

Ian Urbina has thought about passwords as keepsakes for a good long while, and has spoken with dozens about it. His article, [The Secret Life of Passwords](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/magazine/the-secret-life-of-passwords.html), may provide an excellent springboard for a solution to this pandemic of lost value.

<!-- This is a biography. Told by a munch of a man. About much of a man's munching. -->

<!-- As with an onion, there was some unexpected crying, and then some surprisingly sweet tasting. -->

## Hear the lark

**_Of the Sound of Music!!!!!!_**

Wait a minute, that's not how it goes? **JULIE FUCKING ANDREWS, KNIGHT ME AND CROWN ME, BUT DON'T TOUCH ME!** I digress.

    Double quotes in a rage apostrophe?

Does the desert make you smarter?
Does two days at Burning Man make a norm think like an alcoholic and still operate like a reg?
Can a mind reach self-contradiction? Mathematically speaking...?

## Skin

I'll admit, there have been some odd years since today. And I have not—with utterly polite disregard—sent word of unmeaningfully difficult platitudes bent on distressful rending of hair products. Those are fine. Because they are blondes and thus genetically prone to such silky, unapologetically fragrantly clingy spidertentacles. English is not code. You can write much longer sentences in Javascript and remain syntactically correct.

ICALLY: "your languageistics cannottish defectivorate me." // TODO: dialogue skillz are heavily lacking. YAML? Does the L stand for English?

## Can a cryptobiography mean anything?

"Fuck that. If I were 90, I'd start keeping a TO-MEET list. Nearly 7.3 billion. 44K more each day!"

## Unsuccessful Survey Questions

1. On a scale of 1 to hug, how aurtistic are you? (Editor's note: I know because I have consumed one and I/they/we are a rising understanding—unstuck in identity—ready for untold challenges [cognizant]() )
2. How many have you had? (Don't forget your place).
3. I wonder how big are the stars.

## Existential jokes from a 3rd grader

"I can not believe the echoes in here..."
"Never be third."

The question, to my mindow mind window, how and we you're still with me mcClane-ing aganst the gates. What are you, James Joyce? No. James Juice.
