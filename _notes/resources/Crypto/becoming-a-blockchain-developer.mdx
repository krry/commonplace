# Becoming a blockchain developer

The Blockgeeks have been offering plenty of unsolicited advice about how to develop on the blockchains, so I started by combing through their take on things. They, like many blockchain acolytes, use Ethereum and all its open-sourcey platformitude as a springboard.

First we gather some tools/software.

- `geth`, which the Go version of the the Ethereum engine
- Mist, which is a browser built to help us traverse Ethereum blockchains

Then we set up a Testnet.

1. Create a project directory.

```sh
mkdir ethertest; mkdir ethertest/data; cd ethertest
```

2. Create a new account on the Testnet.

```bash
geth account new --datadir ./data
```

Set the password to `namaste`. Received the account's address: `Address: {c2d86b2af8a69913bc06edf25a1438376753fc36}` 3. Add this address to the `CustomGenesis.json` that will generate the genesis block.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": 15,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0
  },
  "difficulty": "0x400",
  "gasLimit": "0x2100000",
  "alloc": {
    "c2d86b2af8a69913bc06edf25a1438376753fc36": {
      "balance": "0x1337000000000000000000"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Initialize the testnet database with the generated account address

```sh
geth --identity "MyTestNetNode" --nodiscover --networkid 1999 --datadir ./data  init CustomGenesis.json
```

5. Run the geth console

```sh
geth --identity "MyTestNetNode" --datadir ./data --nodiscover --networkid 1999 console
```

6. Check the newly seeded account's balance.

```sh
web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0]), “ether”)
```
