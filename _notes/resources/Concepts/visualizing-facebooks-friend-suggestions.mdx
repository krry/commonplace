# Visualizing Facebook's friend suggestions

1. I'd love to see a network graph of the friend suggestions Facebook offers me, something multi-dimensional using D3.js that shows me how many of the suggested friends know certain of my current friends. Perhaps this would be better illustrated in a VR environment.

- Imagine a star cluster. You lie in the center, a black hole of nothingness perhaps, or a brilliant galactic core. Either way, you're in the middle. Nearest to you, the noble core, are suggested friends with the most mutual friends (or friends in common with you as the hoi polloi like to say). They are gently bobbing circular profile photos ringed in mistakably neutral grey. Your ring is your favorite color: fuchsia. Those wiggling suggested heads grow smaller as they lie farther from your astronomical eminence. they *and* you have less mutual friends than morger *Ã©*, get a room, you two.
