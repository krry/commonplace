# The Butter Postulate

Given an edible object X, the enjoyment derived from consuming X increases at a rate logarithmically proportional to the product of the quantity B~M~ and quality B~Q~ of butter applied to X before consumption, until the enjoyment reaches its asymptote at the inflection point of butter utility at which the sensory impact of the applied butter outweighs the sensory impact of the object and after which the enjoyment deteriorates at an exponential rate.
