# Cafe Angiemima

Three choices:
1. Bean
2. Prep
3. Sweet

## Grind slow
Jemima doesn't roast, she brews.
Jemima has friends all over the planet who grow and roast the best beans.

## She hand-prepares each cuppa joe.

Jemima prefers to pour-over, but she'll press French or Chemex. No pre-drip, no yucky gunk.

## Her science is on your tongue.
