by Eres Gabay

An online and offline playful community.
All over the globe!

How is it
going to work?

If you are with me
you have to be
super spontaneous.

Either you shook off your office
or you produce value
wherever you are.

Want an impromptu
apropos adventure
with a blissful sherpa?

Are you nice?
Extraordinary?
Exceptional?

‏How this thing going to work?
‏if you’re part of the group you have to be...
‏super spontaneous
‏You don’t have an office job or you are capable of working online remotely
‏Looking for Adventures
‏pleasant and friendly

This group is private.
Only 300 of us are here.
Each offers $50.
Each stands an equal
chance of escapade,
destination as yet unset,
anywhere in the world.

‏The group is secret and close for 300 people only
‏$50 Required monthly payment
the payment gives you the opportunity to join my journey in a different Unknow destination around the world.

Once you are with us
twice a month might be your time.
You'll want to have a bag packed.
And be able let folks know you'll disappear for a few (5) days.

You are now part of the group and your name is going Straight to the lottery.
twice a month I’m gonna chose one/two names. Randomly

‏From this moment

‏you have 72 hours which is 24 hours to match to pack your bag and tell everyone that you’re going to disappear for two days

To share pictures and experiences of our adventure, we have this group, who can mold our path as we explore.(more on that in a bit)

Public feeds of any sort are improper proper forums. Only in this group, please, which is a safe place for all walks and talks of humans being.

‏If you wanna share pictures and experiences do it only in the group and not in your personal Facebook page and please do not publish the group in any circumstance

You are more than welcome to share things in private face to face moments with your friends.

‏It doesn’t matter where you’re coming from.

‏I’m going to buy tickets back-and-forth in economy or maybe not economy, who knows..

I'll get our flights. Economy perhaps.

I'll arrange our stay, the house, the suite, the bungalow, whatever is cozy and nice.

‏I’m going to pay also for the room house, hotel, Bungalo, whatever feel cozy and nice at the moment

You'll need five free days,
no matter when they fall
in the workweek cycle.
We'll find the right time.

‏Five days from the moment you land. Can be in the middle of the week or long weekend, we can find the perfect time together

During which you won't want for anything: food and drinks, parties, hikes, beaches, trips galore.

‏Food drinks parties and hikes everything included

I am not a traveling company. I have not been everywhere, or more places than you. But I am open and ready to explore and to find the real world with any of you.

‏I’m not a traveling company I’m not a tour guide I have never been in many places around the world but I am open and ready to explore and to find the real world with interesting new people!

It's just me. No brand. No agenda. 0% commercial. 100% friendly. (You've met me, and surprisingly many of us.)

‏There is no small letters here I’m not promoting any company or brand this is 0% commercial and 100% friendly

If anything is unclear, say so. We'll establish the path your way.
We operate on enthusiastic consent,
transparency in the group
and optimal bliss on our journey.

‏Please feel free if you want to ask something or something is unclear women and men as well more than .
‏welcome to join our journey

If ever you feel uncomfortable,
we will guide you,
I will support you,
unless you choose otherwise.

Worst case, we part ways, and you get a few days in your chosen paradise.

‏If you feel uncomfortable at some point just share and tell, the worst case scenario is to split up and you have few days alone in your favorite destination until your
‏flight back.

You are here though. This isn't a worry.

‏If you are part of the group you are cool enough to know how to handle things by yourself.

If it's not your moment, no matter. Your eligibility continues until you bow out. And meanwhile you are a key actor in this community, who feed us ideas for our adventures, who can witness our unrivalable experiences.

‏If you are not the chosen one it’s ok! you still can be part of the community and give us tasks online that we need to do in the place that we are in.

Challenge us. Ask us to trot the globe and give a home to one without. Ask us to make a new friend each day. Be creative.

‏think about something interesting witty, special, challenging, for example taking a homeless from the street to the fancy dinner or just meeting five different people in five different days
Be creative.

$50 a month is something. But you only pay when we travel. And you can bow out. The waiting list fuels the tribe, thanks to the 300 person cap, and those 301 and above.

‏About the 50 bucks it might be a lot of money for you so first of all remember that there is no commitment or time that you need to pay. feel free to leave the group anytime, there is a long waiting list in the group and we will stay 300 people only!

Could be that 500 who offer $30 is the sweet spot. Or 750 who offer $20. Or 100 who offer $150. We can adjust these factors as we hone the community.

‏unless we decide to raise the price and lower the group members or the opposite
.

You (if you are like me)
spend more already on:

- Amazon
- eBay
- rent (rent rent)
- street food
- costumes
- your black pocket mirror
- Netflix and chillz
- gym remembership
- booze (drinks dranks)

‏You’re spending much more on Amazon
‏eBay
‏rent
‏street food
‏clothes
‏cellular
‏TV streaming
‏gym
‏alcohol

Which of these offers you something unforgettable? Those indelible, ineffable moments that define our lives? (Fair point, but skipping around the Mediterranean is another thing entirely.)

‏How many things that you spend a lot of money on them stays with you forever as an unforgettable memory.

Everyone here has been personally invited by someone here. Each of you get three invitations until we hit our cap. An invitation gives you the chance to, well, fly to your dreams in the middle of it all, to jump into the life you need to live.

‏ to be part of given someone else the privilege and the possibility to just accomplish their dream and fly in the middle of their life to crazy adventures this is a lifetime experiences that you going to remember.

We'll choose who goes with me at random, but only among these 300. One out, another in.

‏It’s a lottery but still it’s close for 300 people who were chosen carefully by you. friends of friends one out one in.
‏ this is an exclusive club

Every dollar counts and is accounted for. The purpose is not to spend, but to thrill and bloom and find our bliss, without financial worries. We can channel the rest into the communities we visit, or save it for future travels.

‏Everything is transparent the money is going back to you and it’s not about spending everything and go wild. it’s just about doing things without financial worries.
‏We can chose make some good for other people in our destinations

I believe in people.
So here I am.
This is a personal, social experiment
you, human, can be in.

‏I believe in people
‏This is social experiment.
‏Human.
It’s personal.

With me.
