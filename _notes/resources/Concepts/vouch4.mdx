# Vouch4

Gravity is rough, but it's a rule we can't break (yet). We can at least seek to catch each other when we fall. And at best we can snatch the essences of the moments where we slip, or where others slip, and play them back in slow motion often enough that we learn to avoid those pitfalls. No human can fly when dropped from a few heights up.

But what if we could join arms on our way down? Could we encircle our Earth in a sky-falling net of compassionate hand-holding? Should we? Would the ants try it? They outweigh us. Collectively they may well outthink us, so I'd bow to the ants on this one.

## The concept

A close social network built on mutual trust, confidence, and dependability. You vouch four, they each vouch four and so on. We could all use more trust in our circle.

## Who do you vouch for?

We place trust in others for a variety of reasons. Some of those we trust are overwhelmingly good influences in our lives. Some are rather neutral but at least consistent. Some of those we trust are very unpredictable, but would never betray us. Some might even betray our spoken will to act in our best interest. That latter group may not be trustworthy, but our surveys have uncovered some surprising insights.
