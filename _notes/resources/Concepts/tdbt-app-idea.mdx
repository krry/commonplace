# Tdbt App

### A **tdbt** is a quick, disposable communication.

## Core feedback loop
1. make a audiovisual tdbt
2. send it to a friend
3. receive your friend's reaction

### Features
1. Tdbt maker
* a grid of image/sound pads that fit the screen nicely
* assign images/sounds to the pads: custom or available
** cap of x milliseconds for recordings
** disposal times of sfounds are customizable
** disposal times of stock sounds are set

2. Send the tdbt
* integrate with newer social networks with APIs
* gather contacts via AirDrop, proximity, Chirp (encrypted sound), or disposable auth keys
* allow sharing to older social networks, but not integration
* encode sounds so only the sender and recipient can hear them
* if you have a strong usership, you can push sounds right to the receiver's speaker

3. Capture the reaction
* via sound, still, video, or a.o.t.a.
* you can specify the reaction format you're looking for
* the responder has limited control over how long you can view the response, loosely based on usership
* view and burn the reaction just like the thing you sent
