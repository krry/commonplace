I really like the simple distillation of a lot of research. The historical stuff is great, as is the opportunity stuff. They lost me as United States Progressive Service

I can see rebranding as Post though. "Don't ship it, post it." And then the task would be to eliminate junk mail and focus logistically on minimizing travel distance and time of parcels under a taxpayer cost/environmental initiative. Home delivery personnel can become two-way, making stops to pickup and send packages via fedex and UPS.

Finish the evolution by transitioning post offices and all their individual services windows to be bargain priced tech support and live IT Q&A stations where you can ask things like "how do I set up an ebay store?". It'd be a place where you learn how to Post to the Internet and to other people.
