# Tora
## Nonchronological Development Roadmap

Crowdfunding campaign begins in September/October after the Burn

At the Burn participants in the pilot program test their Toras and are encouraged to tag/mention us.

For every Tora purchased, we will send another to the youth community centers of a region where air pollution is a health concern.

Potentially the chassis of Tora can be 3D printed or laser etched

After testing various filter materials, shapes, and sizes, we offer  varying filter densities and sizes and refill packs.

An ergonomic study uses nostril dimension data to hone filter design and selection.

Filter testing monitors concentration of airborne contaminants such as formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, particulate matter larger than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), and other harmful aerosols, dusts, mists, and sprays.

Etching patterns designed as vectors are mapped onto the Tora ring in 3D model.
