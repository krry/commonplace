    - Conception date calculator?
      - The average human pregnancy these days is 39 weeks long, and gestation is 259 days on average.
        - Humans gestation from conception to birth is typically two weeks less than the period of pregnancy.
        - 39 weeks or 273 days minus 14 days or 2 weeks from last menstruation to ovulation = 259 days avg gestation
      - So conception tends to be 259 days before one's birthday.
