# Human API Spec

## Introduction

The concept is simple. You are an API, a fleshy module with inputs and outputs. So is everyone else.

Once you are aware of this, and aware of your self, you should start tailoring your behaviors to serve the intricacies of your API.

For example, if you are tuned to move rhythmically, dance. And don't stop dancing till you get enough.

Ejemplo dos, if you are tuned for max empathy and quick reaction, become an EMT, save lives.

If you have experienced puberty and have not identified who you are or what you excel at, you have not been properly evaluated. This is a big fucking deal. You may never find fulfillment. You may never find true love.

But...

If you embrace yourself, your identity as a meatbag full of instructions you'll never need to read, then you're in a wonderfully different place.

It's a place at which it has taken me 32 years to arrive. I'm not leaving.
