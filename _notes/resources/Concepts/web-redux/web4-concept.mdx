title: Web4 Concept

# Web4 Concepta new platform, codename: web4

to the user, there is one page type. embedded content with a lo-fi condensed media discussion beneath/next to it. take, for example, a video with a comment thread that can contain and help users generate screengrabs, emoji, limited frame gifs, etc. to join in the fun you have to have an account, but you can view/share/enjoy/play with all the stuff in a logged out state. Change the example content to a readability-enhanced article, or an artistic gif, and the condensed media types may change to suit discussion of that content type. to get an account, you must link in enough people from your twitter or facebook for us to seed your discussions with enough relevant people to fill the room, but you never have to discuss with strangers or trolls because we give the users the private controls to tell the platform who to leave in and who to leave out. downvote a comment and that user doesn't show up for you in other discussions. upvote one and they're more likely to appear to you. toys/apps/tools to use in discussion could be mostly third-party, auto-creative like starparty, or creative indulging like canv.as. and the platform would provide the feedback loops to figure out who to put in which sandbox, and which tools/toys to make available or suggest for a given content discussion. like undrip, the platform can piggyback on Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest for the links/content. Only after that, on web4, users have no need to determine who to follow, what to look up, or which trolls to avoid. After a few visits to our content sandboxes, we'll have enough data to fill a custom feed and continuously improve it. Sounds it'll be brimming with fascinating, relevant articles, images, videos, gifs, and even songs, each with discussions occurring between that user and people they enjoy interacting with. with a mouse-hover/up-arrow heat map overlay game, a user could upvote anything privately -- users, content, tools, apps -- in the platform to make it show up more. gamify the discovery experience

To the potential user:

We'll make our best guesses for who/what/how you want to interact with/about/using based on your previous online behavior. Let us read your Twitter and Facebook activity, and we'll spin a custom web for you.

Tell us how relevant/interesting/exciting a piece of content is by upvoting it, we'll make similarly interest-tagged content more likely to appear to you.

Tell us how you feel about another user's activity, we'll make you more or less likely to interact with them again.

No more trolls, no more searches, no more RSS feeds, no more browsing. Spin your own web.
