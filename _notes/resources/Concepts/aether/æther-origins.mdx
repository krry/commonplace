# Starting Æther

I've been advised to base my company in Nevada where there's no state tax, incorporating is comparatively a cinch. I'd like to start a company, though I'm not exactly sure what I should call it. Before I incorporate, I'd better work through the possibilities.

## Naming my LLC

Recently I've gravitated toward an old glyph: æ. They call it 'ash' or 'aesc'. I connect with this glyph on a multitude of levels:

* the continuity of its path when handwritten is like an open-ended askew infinity
* it holds a duality, a complementary, inverted symmetry
* it is a phonemic chameleon
* it was most widely used by scholars in the Dark and Middle Ages
* the individual vowels loosely map to those of my first name: Kerry
* its winding curves express self-knowledge, self-negation, an intellect's struggle for identity in a global namespace
* calling it 'ash' allows for metaphorical access to the legend of the phoenix, a glorious beast reborn from the ashes of its self-sacrifice. This connection to the Phoenix brings a wealth of welcome symbolism involving magenta (the purple-red dye for which the Phoenicians retain historical fame) and cyclical immortality or *metempsychosis*

### Possible names

Let's start with æ.

Option-' on my Mac.

Shift-option-' yields a capital ash: Æ.

ash
æsh
æther
ether
asher
phoenix
phaenix
phænix
fænix

I'm compelled toward the phoenix. Its origins lie in the way the Greeks referred to the people of Tyre by the reddish-purple dye they produced from the secretion of an indigenous, predatory sea snail called the Murex by Aristotle. The murex itself is a hideous creature, but it is one of few on earth to traverse the light spectrum into the magentas and maroons. The Phoenicians are thought to have invented the alphabet as well, though that word 'alphabet' also stems from the Greek via their ordinal letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, etc. Those people of the Phoenix lived in a land called Canaan.
