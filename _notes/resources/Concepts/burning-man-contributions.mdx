Hello dear Burner,

I'm Kerry, a virgin burner hopeful in search of one or two tickets.

I'm told it's proper to only pay face value for a ticket, which I'll happily do. I'm also willing to throw in volunteer time for personal projects, community projects, or other humanitarian efforts that you hold dear.

My two best and dearest friends won the ticket lottery this year. One of them is a veteran burner who has been trying to get us to attend for years. The other is a virgin burner who has long been stranded in the Midwest, mired in money problems and tending to aging parents for all the years we other two have soaked up the rays in sunny California. It's to be our first reunion in years. Only I haven't yet found a ticket.

I've been putting a lot of thought into potential personal contributions should I be given the opportunity to attend.

Here's my short list of ideas:
* **Rainbow Touch**
I'll paint neon rainbow stripes on the body of who wants them. They're applied with a sponge, last for days, and wash off easily. Those bearing stripes form a stochastic tribe that will have chance encounters all over the Playa.
* **Kerry Magdalene**
I'll set up a mobile foot-washing station, complete with Dr. Bronner's, a vinegar solution to pH balance the alkalinity of the playa dust, and responsible gray water disposal. I'll wear a white gown and a wig made of absorbent microfiber cloth with which I will dry people's feet. Post-wash peacock feather tickling is optional.
* **Lemonheads**
On your knees (here's a pad). Tilt your head back and open your maw. I'll provide a spoonful of honey, juice half a lemon into your mouth, and top it off with a shot of vodka (or purified water). Shake it up and swallow it down. Chase it with a loving embrace from yours truly.
* **Dunkaroo**
This is an S&M option adopted from a neighboring camp at High Sierra. We'll provide a dunk tank for your face. Plunge your head into the tank for a 10-count. My two assistants will spank you 10 times as we count and chant "DUNKAROO!" When you come up for air, you'll get a swift slap to the face. Nothing scarring, just a quick "How's your mother?" Finish it with a shot of whiskey, and you'll feel more invigorated than you have in days.
* **Father Bird**
The tender option. Chewing is hard work: let me do it for you. I'll don my falcon head and wings, you wear the baby bird beak. You choose the food (edibles only please), then lie back and relax. When you're ready to eat, open wide and I'll extrude a nicely chewed bite into your baby beak. No food, we've got oranges. Baby birds love oranges.
