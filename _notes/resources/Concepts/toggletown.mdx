Let's lay down some groundwork to help you use toggles in a way that both humans and computers will understand.
1. If a user must choose between two alternatives, make sure the two alternatives are known up front, not later discovered. E.g., human vs. robot.
2. If the two alternatives are a state and the negative of that state, using a well-known on/off toggle paradigm is sufficient. e.g., checkbox, push button switch. E.g., charging vs. not charging.
3. If the alternatives are non-standard, visually emphasize the labels of the alternatives and avoid using pictographs or symbols where they might come off as ambiguous or unfamiliar. E.g., maritime vs. continental.
4. If the alternatives are standard or well-known, consider simplifying the switch with symbols rather than words. E.g., money vs. time, or dog vs. cat.
