# Leo Turns Four

In the back of the magic toy store
lies a secret magic toy door
where Mr. Bojangles sits and waits
for password-singing kids to gracefully arrive.

# TET

the handheld origami pyramid game you now or crave to clutch where we:
- roll TET
- look bottom

- pass right

## Gameplay

If you roll first, make whatever sound dance or face you want to.

If you roll after that, repeat the last moves but replace whatever you rolled with your new-new sound/dance/face.

## Core rolls
