## What is a souvenir?

A souvenir is a memory manifested in an object. It is a memento of a moment with a time, place, event, and/or (often especially) participants.

### Traditional souvenirs

A souvenir is a thing kept as a reminder of a place, a time, an event, or a person. Often they commemorate a combination of these. Many of us will envision a trinket: an item from a tourist shop, a craft hand-made by a local of a place we're visiting, or some other portable object that reminds us of that time, place, or event. Many souvenirs end up reminding us of whom we were with, or whom we wished we were with.

Please pardon the vitriol of the succeeding bit. I got gloriously mad about the potential of souvenirs recently, and then I got mad about their status quo. 

In my young travels, souvenirs have been a poison, a monetary toxin, a parasite to avoid. They distract me while I travel, fill my luggage, then inhabit the tables or mantles of loved ones until they become sentimental pith. They gather dust until some newer, but equally unwanted, souvenir appears to displace them. Have we stained our souvenirs as our middle-class economies, especially our tourist economies, have been overrun by dirty, rotten capitalists?

"Wistfully stroll our beautiful beaches. Sift the shores for our seashells. Try the clam chowder at any of our fifteen identical roadside attractions. Choose from hundreds of Chinese-made (pump 'em out) plastic objects or cheeky over-sized t-shirts ([RIP to all the needlessly crushed souls in Dhaka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Dhaka_fire))—each of them absurdly emblazoned with the name of whatever forgettable town you happen to be standing in. Hopefully you'll forever remember this moment you spent trapped in 'murican tourist hell when you dust off this nonsensical, non-functional, utterly useless souvenir that wasn't made anywhere near here."

It can't be so bad everywhere else. I haven't toured Europe, but I'll venture to guess they make some of their lasting mementos of times spent in town from… well… in town. And some American locales must too. Don't tell that to Fisherman's Wharf or Hollywood Boulevard, but I've found some excellent, authentic shops along Mono Lake, and Pioneertown near Joshua Tree has a welcoming, burgeoning true-true.

In Japan travelers return with *omiyage* as obligated apologies for their absence. They tend to choose uniquely local goods called [*meibutsu*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meibutsu), regional cuisine or handicrafts. We all like sweets, we all like artisanal widgets and moppets, we all like to be remembered by those who wayfare. But even the poignant nostalgia of these Fujian returning gifts falls short. They are not part of it. She left, she found it, she returned with it, but it was her he wanted all along. Please mix the "she"s and "he"s at your leisure, I had to opt for one because English grammar.

Adverbially I'm hoping you've encounted the ubiquitous pop-up shops I'm railing against on some of your roadtrips and travails. Some even house bins of shells that were professionally combed from beaches situated tens of thousands of miles from the beach where you hoped your four-year-old daughter could scoop just a single shell out of the sand on your family foray, rather than fending her fingers off all that gull dung and those dead jellies caked in rotten seal entrails.

Here in the States I hope you've encountered the other type of souvenirs too. We still have local craftsfolk in the States offering their blissfully molded localwares to passers-through. Perhaps the American dreamworks no longer produce a worry-free life near a natural wonder tying the indigenous vines into artful wonders for those who care to visit your piece of heaven. Perhaps we collectively and individually want too much because we see plenty of space around us and we misinterpret it as room to grow, as mere space to claim. Perhaps we yearn to dominate this aging New World in a way our grand-grand-grand-grand-parents might have chortled in frightful whispers.

A tree will lean toward the sun and with each breeze stretch for the rays it seeks. A squirrel will busily bury its nutty fortune into the freezing turf. Life seeks to survive, often to thrive, and when its permitted by its environment, it over-strives.

### Digital souvenirs

A souvenir—as I use it here—is a digital object you create with someone you meet at a certain place and time, perhaps during an event. You can share the souvenir with them on a communication platform or social network. The souvenir contains your contact info, whatever you prefer to share.

## Common issues with contacts

### Entry is clumsy, techniques vary
It can be difficult to enter a new contact when you prefer to connect on different social platforms.

- First you must agree upon a platform.
- Then one of you must open that app and find the other.
- Sometimes the other must still approve or accept the invitation to connect.

### Not enough context captured on entry
It can be difficult to record relevant metadata about a new contact, regardless of the platform on which you connect.

- How can I record where we met?
- How can I record when we met?
- How can I remember who introduced us?
- How can I remember what they look like?

### Difficult to find anyone without having memorized their name
It can be difficult to recall a new contact by name, or even on which platform you connected.

- If their name escapes you, there are few tools at your disposal for recalling it.
- If the platform escapes you, but their name does not, you have to search for them by name.
- If the platform and name both escape you, you'll have to guess.
