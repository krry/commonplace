# feelswall
「feelsmall」???

## an full-sensory installation

- literally a wall
	- that holds experiences
	- which are multisensory
	- and triggered variously
- the participants create a remix of lights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes
- periodically a treat with various textures, glows, scents, vibrations, and tastes
- participants place it on the wall
- the feelswall is alive; its output bends to the participants' wills
