## Irrational number

Any number that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers.

- _$\phi$_ - Golden Ratio

### Transcendental number

A real or complex number that is not algebraic—that is, it is not a root of a nonzero polynomial equation with integer (or, equivalently, rational) coefficients. Transcendental numbers and algebraic numbers make up the set of real numbers. Real numbers are uncountable, and algebraic numbers are countable, so transcendental numbers are uncountable.

- _π_
  - ≈22⁄7
  - the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter
- _e_
  - base of the natural logarithm
  - Euler's number
  - the limit of {1 + 1⁄n}^n^ as n -> ∞, the root of continuous compounding interest
  - _d[e^x^]⁄dx = e^x^_
  - _e_ is the global maximum of _x^1⁄x^_

## Dimensionless Physical Constants

- _α_
  - ≈1⁄137
  - =​1⁄137.035999139(31)=0.0072973525664(17)
  - the fine structure constant, the coupling constant for the electromagnetic interaction
  - Also the square of the electron charge, expressed in Planck units, which defines the scale of charge of elementary particles with charge
  - _4πε~0~ħcα = e^2^_, where:
    - _e_ is the elementary charge,
    - _ħ_ is the reduced Planck's constant,
    - _c_ is the speed of light,
    - _π_ is pi,
    - _ε~0~_ is the permittivity of free space.
- _μ_ or _β_
  - ≈1836
  - the proton-to-electron mass ratio
  - the rest mass of the proton divided by that of the electron
- _α~s~_
  - ≈1
  - the coupling constant for the strong force
- _α~G~_
  - ≈10^−45^
  - the gravitational coupling constant which is the square of the electron mass, expressed in Planck units.
  - This defines the scale of the masses of elementary particles and the ratio of _α~G~_ to the other coupling constants has also been used to express the strength of gravitation relative to the other interactions.

## Martin's Rees Just Six Numbers

Any plausible fundamental physical theory must be consistent with these six constants, and must either derive their values from the mathematics of the theory, or accept their values as empirical.

- _N_
  - _N=α⁄α~G~_
  - ≈10^36^
  - the ratio of the fine structure constant (the dimensionless coupling constant for electromagnetism) to the gravitational coupling constant, the latter defined using two protons.
  - _N_ governs the relative importance of gravity and electrostatic attraction/repulsion in explaining the properties of baryonic matter.
- _ε_
  - ≈0.007
  - The fraction of the mass of four protons that is released as energy when fused into a helium nucleus.
  - _ε_ governs the energy output of stars, and is determined by the coupling constant for the strong force.
- _Ω_
  - ≈0.3
  - the ratio of the actual density of the universe to the critical (minimum) density required for the universe to eventually collapse under its gravity.
  - _Ω_ determines the ultimate fate of the universe. If _Ω ≥ 1_, the universe will experience a Big Crunch. If _Ω < 1_, the universe will expand forever.
- _λ_
  - ≈0.7
  - The ratio of the energy density of the universe, due to the cosmological constant, to the critical density of the universe. Others denote this ratio by Ω~λ~
- _Q_
  - ≈10^−5^
  - The energy required to break up and disperse an instance of the largest known structures in the universe, namely a galactic cluster or supercluster, expressed as a fraction of the energy equivalent to the rest mass m of that structure, namely _mc^2^_
- _D_
  - =3
  - the number of macroscopic spatial dimensions

## Empirically Measured/Dimensioned Constants

- _h_
  - Planck's constant
  - quantum of action
  - ≈6.626070040(81)×10^−34^ J⋅s (in Joule⋅seconds)
  - _E = hf_
- _c_
  - speed of light
  - ≈2.99792458×10^8^ m⁄s (in meters per second)
- _ε~0~_
  - vacuum permittivity
  - ≈8.854187817620...×10^−12^ F⁄m (in Farads per meter)
- _G_
  - gravitational constant
  - ≈6.674×10^−11^ m^3^⁄kg⋅s^2^ (in cubic meters per kilogram per second per second)
- _μ~0~_
  - magnetic constant - permeability of free space
  - ≈4π × 10^−7^ H⁄m
