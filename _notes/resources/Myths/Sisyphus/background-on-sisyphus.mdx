# A Sisyphean Research Effort

## Family tree of Sisyphus

Father: Aeolus, king of Thessaly, was the father of Sisyphus
Mother: Enarete
Brother: Salmoneus
Wife: Merope was the wife of Sisyphus
Sons: Glaucus, Thersander, Almus, Ornytion, Sinon
Grandson: Bellerophon

Bellerophon rode Pegasus.
Aeolus commanded the winds themselves.
Sinon can take care of the family now.

“The most intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth... their delight is in self-mastery… They regard a difficult task as a privilege; it is to them a recreation to play with burdens that would crush all others.”  

— Friedrich Nietzsche

## Inspiration

It started with five-minute rounds at several writing prompts from Reddit's [sub WritingPrompts](http://reddit.com/r/writingprompts). My favorite of the prompts?

> Instead of a dystopia that seems like a utopia on the surface, write a story about a utopia that seems like a dystopia on the surface.

What follows is what I initially flashed out:

	The breeze smells like fish.
	I've eaten fish for lunch and dinner all week.
	Always the same fish, the others aren't around anymore.

	My shoulders are sore from work.
	That boulder never gets lighter, never smaller.
	Gravity never eases off, never lessens its pull.

	And Zeus. I know he's watching from the Cloud.
	If I hadn't locked up his big bro, I wouldn't be here.
	
	They fucked with my woman, and my woman fucked with me, and now I'm here.

	But hey, everybody needs something to do.
	This is my path, and I'm okay with that.
	I feel contentment having something to master.

	I love this life. I feel strong. I feel purpose.
	In the eyes of some, I may toil. But I roll bliss up the mountain, and bliss rolls back down.

After this quick take I was inspired. I found that I had channeled Camus' "The Myth of Sisyphus" which asks us to imagine Sisyphus happy. Truly this would be a utopia that seems like a dystopia on the surface. Of what worse curse have we conceived? Tantalus has to stand in water he can't drink below a fruit tree he can't harvest. Atlas holds the heavens away from the earth to stop them from making Cronus any baby siblings. Those two might be tortured, but they might find solace more easily than Sisyphus, who is subject to eternal toil and disappointment.

## Accounts of Sisyphus in old texts

- ["Aeolus reigned over the regions about Thessaly and named the inhabitants Aeolians. He married Enarete, daughter of Deimachus, and begat seven sons, Cretheus, **Sisyphus**, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, Magnes, Perieres, and five daughters, Canace, Alcyone, Pisidice, Calyce, Perimede."](http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html) - Apollodorus 1.7.3
- ["And Sisyphus, son of Aeolus, founded Ephyra, which is now called Corinth, and married Merope, daughter of Atlas. They had a son Glaucus, who had by Eurymede a son Bellerophon, who slew the fire breathing Chimera. But Sisyphus is punished in Hades by rolling a stone with his hands and head in the effort to heave it over the top; but push it as he will, it rebounds backward. This punishment he endures for the sake of Aegina, daughter of Asopus; for when Zeus had secretly carried her off, Sisyphus is said to have betrayed the secret to Asopus, who was looking for her."](http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html)
- ["He was notorious as the most cunning knave on earth. His greatest triumph came at the end of his life, when the god Hades came to claim him personally for the kingdom of the dead. Hades had brought along a pair of handcuffs, a comparative novelty, and Sisyphus expressed such an interest that Hades was persuaded to demonstrate their use - on himself."](http://www.mythweb.com/encyc/entries/sisyphus.html)
- [In his apocryphal dialogue with Socrates, Sisyphus, who led Pharsalus in Thessaly, accepts that deliberation consists in "somebody trying to find out the best course to follow in matters requiring him to take action".](http://branemrys.blogspot.com/2014/05/sisyphus.html) Furthermore, they discuss that since one can deliberate only with prior understanding, and one can only seek knowledge with prior ignorance, deliberation cannot be a tool for seeking knowledge. Deliberation can only be used on past understanding, not for future projections. From "Sisyphus" or "On Deliberation", apocryphally by Plato from the 4th century B.C.E.
- [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer) and [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod) account for much of our knowledge of Sisyphus and his progenitors. They each lived, supposedly, around 750 BCE and after. Homer is harder to place in time than Hesiod, who seems to have written more down, though he may have made less of a popular impression. [Hyginus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Hyginus) also gives various accounts of Sisyphus and his progenitors. There's something special about rapping 8000 bars, ain't it!?
