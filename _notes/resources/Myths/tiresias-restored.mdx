[Chariclo, who is a devotee of Athena, was a nymph who became pregnant by a shepherd, Everes, giving birth to the prophet Tiresias. Tiresias was struck blind by Athena after seeing her naked. Chariclo begged Athena to give him sight back, but the goddess could not undo her curse. She gave him the gift of prophecy instead.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariclo)
