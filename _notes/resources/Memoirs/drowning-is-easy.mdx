# How to drown yourself and live to write about it

As some of you may know I recently had a near-death experience. Actually two of them, but we'll get to that. I'd like to share a full account of how it came to that, what went on, which risks were ill-advised, which aspects of the situation were harmless, and lastly what I have learned from all this.

#### TL;DR
I was apnea training improperly when I blacked out and drowned. My friend and his brother resuscitated me. Then I started to dry drown. Another friend recognized that and saved my life all over again. Pure oxygen and bronchial dilation aided my recovery. My lungs recovered in a week. Then I wrote this account.

## A peaceful beachfront community

The incidents leading to my eventual drowning started while camping on the beach near Pescadero. When we arrived, some friends were unstrapping a piece of unusual cargo from the top of a well-loved Prius: a corrugated steel basin eight feet in diameter. On one side of the basin a coiled pipe passed through the steel wall in two places and was welded into place. The coil wound horizontally down from the higher opening to the lower one, evoking a tube slide at a water park, or an old wooden rollercoaster.

We filled the basin with ocean water one large bucket at a time. Then under the coil next to the basin, we dug a shallow hole in the sand and built a compact fire. As the fire heated up, we dropped chopped logs vertically down into the center of the coil. These logs soon became part of the fire, and began heating the water throughout the coil. The water in the coil began to travel from the bottom hole upwards through the coil and out the top hole back into the basin.

After several hours of heating, the basin was a salt-water hot tub. In the meantime we did a geodesic dry-run. I'm told it was a "five-eighths" dome, meaning it was five-eighths of a sphere when fully constructed. We got about half of a dome put together before night fell heavily enough to draw us inside for dinner then outside for revelation.

After indulging in heaping plates of potlucky dishes from hearths all over the Bay Area, we darted to the beach to fire up a roaring bon, compared to the gentle flicker alongside the marine hot tub. I may have had a little to do with the size of the secondary blaze. We danced and sang along to the classics on the Boomcase. Some of the crazier kids spun fire and LED poi.

## Whatever floats your soul

It didn't take long until the early-to-risers had retired. Those with dignity and/or self-respect soon flipped sand back to their saline-sprayed tents. The rest of us clambered into the now-toasty hot ocean tub, and learned a new trick.

Once we had acclimated to the water and each others' company, one of my favorite beings in this crew, let's call him Moe, proposed we try some apnea training. It was new to me—perhaps not to the other several floaters—but I was immediately fascinated. Our apnea training that night took the form of a sort of group meditation or therapy session. We had a trusted circle of friends. Moe guided us through the theory and the breathing techniques. And throughout that night on into the wee hours practiced flooding our bodies' blood with oxygen then submerging to respire calmly in a warm, salty cocoon of trust and needlessness.

Several of us topped three minutes under water that night. It wasn't a competition of course—just a measured meditation. A safe place where one could explore the depths of one's respiratory capabilities while several others allowed you to float in blissful nothingness. A makeshift divers' "dep" tank, perhaps. My fondest memories involve moonlight glistening on a floating figure in the center of our tiny, heated ocean. She or he would rotate ever so slowly—as with the tide or the wind or the earth itself—without twitch, or worry, or thought.

We took several turns each. I remember leaving the tub feeling more full of oxygen than I ever have. What a glorious breathing exercise! What a peaceful state to revisit!

That morning I slept. That morning I made love on the beach in a tent as the ocean breeze swept softly in with the lapping Pacific waves. I'd had a revelation, or so I thought.

## Cross-training season

Months passed. I continued to crave the peace of submersion. But rarely does one find himself in the proper company and context.

Then in December I cut the tethers and shed the trappings of the modern American "***yupster***". (That's a yuppie/hipster. Thank @dzello for the coinage.) I quit my lovely job at SolarCity. I quit my feces-sprayed McCoppin apartment. I left my car on Getaround, available for rent from a locked parking garage in the Mission—which earns me money without my involvement. I sold my furniture to a delightful SF-newcomer with a new apartment to furnish in the Sunset. To my neighbor—a budding chef and all-around fascinating human being—I gifted my carefully curated kitchenware as repayment for her bike, which I had borrowed and which had been since claimed by that Burning Man. My extensive board game collection found a home with a dear friend; she's a game designer.

Anything I couldn't get rid of constructively ended up in a storage unit in what I call the "Sphincter of San Francisco". This is a strong appellation considering that city's preoccupation with that orifice, but I press on. There is a place where many of the main thoroughfares of the cities intersect and intertwine in a mess of bewildering turn-lanes and on-off-ramps. Much of this area is literally and daily splattered with the excrement of the underprivileged and domicile-deprived. It is quite central—a wormhole to many neighborhoods—but it is filthy and neglected.

## Countdown to the redux

With my remaining possessions crammed up SF's ass, I hit the road. One moto, three bags, two boots, and a hammock. I was first drawn to a little valley outside of LA they call Simi.

My dear friends in Simi inhabit a lovely villa on a hill overlooking a golf course. They have lived there since they were married; he has lived there since he was a young boy. Some years ago his parents turned the house over to the newlyweds and upgraded to new digs across town. Before they did though, they installed a wonderful infinity pool and a hot tub which have seen continual and glorious use for as long as I have visited these parts.

I rocketed south through salad country and over the icy Grapevine to reach their oasis. As I thawed in their driveway and then foyer, I came to find even more warmth and hospitality than I anticipated. For two weeks they graciously put me up. Just as I had hoped to, I had found the perfect springboard into this new odd phase of productive play—into my "pretirement".

During the day I had time to write, sun to bask in, and nothing to worry about. At night we reveled in an ever-varying adult playground: [Yoga Galactica](https://www.facebook.com/yogagalactica/) and a professionally recorded *Om* ceremony, [LA's best Korean BBQ](http://www.parksbbq.com/), [*Rick and Morty*](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty/), a cauldron of collagenic chicken soup, a dozen decanters of dozen-year scotch, and one hot tub time machine.

## It's a great night for a soak

Then one night the crew shot off to see the new Star Wars. When they bought the tickets days prior I had been planning to be in Joshua Tree during the showing. The timing and weather didn't abide my trip to JT, so I ended up hanging back and cleaning house while they battled in the stars.

My buddy's brother and two of his friends from college came over that night. We goofed around at a local dive bar, played some darts, talked to some meth-heads and non-meth-heads. Then we retired to the villa for an evening soak.

Once the six of us (my dear friends who live there, his brother,  his brother's two pals, and myself) had settled into the suds, I floated apnea training out there as a possible activity. They were receptive. I explained how it worked, channeling Moe as best I could, and we began taking turns filling ourselves with oxygen and then floating below the surface.

## Four shadowy undercurrents

In hindsight I had neglected some key premises from Moe's preamble and guiding principles of the practice itself:

1. Air is the primary need of Earthly life.
2. Submersion is not the objective. Meditation is the objective. Breathe deeply, then float as peacefully as possible. If submersion makes the float more peaceful, then submerge.
3. In order to foster a peaceful meditation for each floater, the other soakers can remain quiet and still during each float. This lends a calm mood to the practice, and minimizes underwater vibrations that can disrupt a floater's meditation.
4. Here's the kicker: a floater must always have a guide monitoring their float, speaking softly to them, keeping hand on them to ensure they are conscious.

## The fateful float

We each took a turn or two. Everyone seemed to enjoy their first forays into flotation therapy. The group's attention gradually turned from meditation back to carousing. I found myself craving one last dive before transitioning back to party mode.

I softly hyperventilated for a couple minutes. I could feel the fully oxygenated hemoglobin ricocheting through my veins. My heart was beating slowly and strongly.

I felt fine, then began coughing more and more heavily for hours. I refused medical attention; my friends listened to me. Another friend realized I was dry drowning and saved my life for the second time that night by diagnosing that condition then insisting on taking me to the hospital.
