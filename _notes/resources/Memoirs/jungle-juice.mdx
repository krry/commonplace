This reminds me of a similar dilemma I had in college. I got my first apartment when I was 19. $245 a month, for a bedroom on the top floor of a three story roach hotel. There were "squirrels" in the walls and the whole place was leaning enough that round things wouldn't sit still. But to me, it represented freedom distilled.

To celebrate I suggested to my flatmates that we throw a party. They were all for it. And we planned accordingly.

Come the night of the party, our inner circles had started to arrive, and the question of money arose. "How much for a cup?"

At this Uni among the cornfields, the party thrower's custom was to find a trough or a barrel, fill it with grain alcohol and flavor-scienced high fructose corn syrup beverages, and then sell red Solo cups to guests for a buck or five, thereby deftly sidestepping the legal ramifications of peddling booze without a liquor license.

Opinions differed. My roommates had dollar signs in their eyes. I wanted to celebrate my freedom, and had $60 burning a hole in my pocket from my nights as a library barista. Having already dipped my cup into the trough, I offered to buy all the cups. We were all aware that dozens, if not hundreds, of Solo cups had made it home from the box store du jour. But the jest was enough to break the tension, to snip the deeply-rooted capitalistic mind loop wound around the heels of our hearts.

We threw a great party and didn't sell a cup. A lot of people we had never met showed up. One of them enjoyed our trough enough to perforate the wall with his fist. The next day I wondered if the slope of the floor had always been so visually apparent. And in the hazy years after that I recall throwing several more rebelliously non-commercial parties, and even attending a few. It didn't catch like wildfire, as I hoped and still hope in a cold dark corner of my inner cellar, but I can't imagine selling tickets to a party.
