I am a son of the United States of America, vintage 1982.  I don't wanna work for it, but don't tell anyone.  I'll swear up and down if anyone's listening that I have a heartily competitive spirit, that I'll bust my ass, Christian work-ethic in tow, for a dime or a dollar or a million simoleons.  Money is my mythology, consumerism my religion, the free market my house of worship.

10:22 ante meridian, October 1988.  Age 6, 1st grade in a Catholic school in a blue collar Midwestern city.

Mrs. Waldorf peers over her silver wire-framed glasses, lenses the size of tea saucers and nearly as opaque.  "Okay boys and girls, time to take out your reading books.  We're starting on the next lesson today, reading aloud.  We'll start at the back of the classroom today, with the end of the alphabet for a change."

Katie Winn, bob haircut, red and navy blue plaid skirt, white polo, blissful surprise sparkling through the hole in her smile, wriggles in her seat, the toes of her Keds just dabbing at the Desert Storm terrazzo.  She already has her finger on the first line of the lesson, already has the self-confidence of a 7 year old, already knows her place in the world it seems.  With a nod from the teacher, she begins: "Adam goes to the store.  Apples are on sale today.  He buys an apple for Eve."

Looking back, I should have puked with disgust at this vicious and subversive indoctrination.  In fact, one day in Waldorf's class, I did puke.  All over my desk.  All over my orange crayon, sized for a fist, and the pulpy picture of Jesus giving a sermon.  I was doing the skin parts with orange. Everyone did.  Skin is orange when you're only given 8 Crayolas (or Rosearts for the kids with cheap moms).  Luckily my sick missed the other 7 which were organized like everything in my tiny world at the time, neatly in their yellow and dark green box.  Red, gap, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple (Violet), Black, Brown.  Lid flap closed, package in the upper left corner of the desk, aligned parallel and equidistant to the edges.  Things were so simple then.

For the next few weeks Jesus had yellow skin with red and brown shading and I learned that I would not become an artist.  In the meantime, the Gospel of Spend was read daily just before morning recess, four sentences at a time, proceeding through the torturous alphabetical order of our surnames.  At some point that year, I became "Schneider" because my last name is terribly difficult to pronounce if you're a blue collar asshole's child.  It's Snyder.  Sn-I-der.  Sn-EYE-der.  Fuck it.  Dad says people called him Schneider too.  At first it seemed that calling a kid by his last name was a way to elevate oneself socially.  A distancing.  But as the kids and I sorted out, made friendships, made enemies, traded chips at lunch and dared each other to swat bees and climb trees, at some point Springer became Jake, and Carlson became Vail.  First names were reserved for people that wouldn't tell the girls who you "liked".  People that wouldn't Benedict Arnold my skinny ass in Four-Square.  People that blocked for you in two-hand touch (read: shove like a sumbitch) football.

Actually Vail didn't do any of those things to earn a first name basis.  He ate worms, then immediately kissed girls, did not abide the 5-second rule, and never knew what line we were on in the Gospel of Spend.  He didn't play football or four-square.  He always lost anyway, I don't blame him.  Some kids grow faster than others.  And some kids grow gills behind their ears and webs between their toes.  I grew fast, but only speedwise, not in size since I was nearly a year younger than the average Schmo in my grade.  Vail grew into the love child of Mogwai meets the Creature from the Black Lagoon.

I was the second shortest kid (which means boy to a first grader at my school, since girls were still an alien species of some sort) in my grade.  Vail Carlson, then me.  I suppose I felt an obligation to ignore his clandestine but well-known deformities, because he was Shrimp and not me.  I was just Schneider, and they picked me second for football most of the time.  Anyway, the school's second favorite way to enqueue their students was by height.  And they loved putting us in a line.  The expressions "get in line" or "get put in line" never held any mystery for me.  I spent my first few years of social awareness in the rear of lines which had not been ordered according to any apparent overriding system of justice or merit.  Rarely, when the teachers or administrators were caught unawares, the anarchy of a "first-come, first-served" line was tolerated, but only for as long as it took to empty and with thunderstorms of scolding showering at the clusters of buddies and BFFs.  Why didn't they want us to be next to our friends?  Was this some sort of preparation for life blossoming from the wisdom of the Catholic gorgons who taught us?  If it was, I still have not attained their level of pious enlightenment.

Back to Vail.  He and I would somewhat frequently end up lined up at the edge of the altitudinal bell curve.  School picture day for example.  Christmas Pageant stage direction.  First Communion, by height, what in the Holy Fuck does height have to do with receiving the Eucharist?  I now suspect the priests in our pariochal faculty had height-related boy fetishes.  And Principal Smerko, in league with these unforgiveable pederasts, wrote the rulebook (literally).  But that's a different story for a more melancholy day.

Vail, with his eyes enormous, round, and wideset like an owl, had two expressions.  Mischief and suspicion.  Today it was mischief but he wasn't even up to anything, just standing complacently, maybe plotting a caper.  Roll call in the background, "Bridgelane, Sarah"… meek, paste-eating Sarah raises her hand like a curtsy.  "Cook, Mike" (snickers erupt like popcorn) … Mike, busy farming for boogers to consume, raises left hand with a marionette's casual limpidity.  On down the alphabet while lined up by height, really rubbing in the hierarchical classist philosophy we were steeping in like moth-eaten tea bags.  I know I lost some guts in those years.  Back then I had some raw courage.  Like a PCP addict throwing cars type of courage.  Chew your leg off to escape a bear trap courage.

Flash forward, my bravery continues, waning but throbbing.

3:07 post meridian, April 1989, 2nd grade, the dismissal bell rings.  That's what people do when they are done using you.  Dismissal.  I slowly meander across the recess yard, which is an ocean of splintery wood chips circumferenced by a jagged railroad tie shoreline which was elevated to just the right height to trip you while you scurried in a utter terror with the football for the final hurdle out of the woodchip sea into the end zone.  There were many injuries.  Tim Stuker became a notorious sissy for crying "MAH-MEEEE!!!" every time his palms and knees got skinned in such a trip.  Today there had been no injuries, and unbeknownst to Vail and myself, Rosa Hernandez seethed with unsatiated bloodlust.  She was in 1st grade, was as tall as a Kindergartner and weighed as much as a 7th grader.  Her ponytail was nearly as long as Vail, poor little Mogwai.  Toting my Spiderman backpack and sporting my Nike Air Force high-tops across the wooden hazard zone, I came upon a bewildering sight in the church's lawn between the school and the parking lot where mom and Allie sat waiting in the maroon Vanagon.  Rosa, seated on an undecipherable mess of limbs and school uniform, with her ponytail like a widow's veil hanging over the purple straining face of my partner in shortness.  Vail!  He's dying!

My blood boiled.  I became a rabid elephant.  Rage as though I had never felt anything but bliss.  My face must have glowed red like an electric stove element on high.  Backpack down, shoulder down, CHAAARRRRRRGE!

What happened to me next was the same as what would happen to a raging bull that runs full speed into a silicone breast implant the size of a dumptruck.  I felt the softness envelop me, absorb me, and then I slid, somehow violently considering all the cushioning, to the ground, flat on my back.  Rosa, hoisted herself into a makeshift sumo stance, facing away from me, and collapsed like a pre-Subway Jared on his couch, only I was the couch.  Blackness. Warm navy corduroy death shroud.   "Mommy?" I peeped.  Tim Stuker would have been proud.  Who you gonna call?  Ghostbu…

When I came to, if I ever actually went out, Mom was heaving the one-girl hogpile off of me.  Apparently she was doing PCP at the time too.  Rosa rolled to a stop in the grass, caterpillared to her feet like a two-year-old, and lumbered away with a vindictive air of obesity.  Maybe she was just looking for a seat because they put the parking lot too far from the school.  Maybe Vail was her one true love and I interrupted their first attempt at coitus.  Maybe my ribs were broken.  I only knew one thing for sure.  It was something standing in line at the store could fix.  So I waited my turn, and got a grape Crush to soothe my aching pride.
