# My Anonymous Will
Well, it's public
You figure it out

What follows was once known as Front Matter, sometimes written in `yaml` (that's that shiznucket between the two rows of three dashes). After the FrontMatter (I like Pucking with the casings and spacings on this one), you've got `markdown`. I've never met its supposed inventor [@gruber](https://twitter.com/gruber). He's a roguish, stubborn funt of a cuck who only breathes and shits and is seen on Tuesdays and who could have led an entire planet of hapless gurgling, stomach-recycling semi-sentients to salvation if the Speaker of the Dead happened to land on it while he was in office, perhaps incumbent though I doubt his campaigning skills.

You're going to be surprised at how little else I swear in the rest of this. Oh and stop running your linguistic analyzers. You're never going to figure it out. And these mincing hackers you've tapped. Tip them off. I covered every track. You'll NEVER FUCKING FIND ME. I (the author) am not even an actual individual human being. This will was written by a mixed conglomerate of jizzbots and tapposaurs. The latter were overjoyed to find keyboards rather than the asses of the underprivileged under their tapper-tendrils. I scoff at my hubris. Which is in fact, my hubris: self-awareness of knowledge of nothingness. Socrates poured out a hemlock to me BCE 900—what was it?—maybe BCE 4000?—oh, fuck that imaginary dead shit anyway. Some monks made him up somewhere around the time Jesus was born when that whole Septuagint/Pentateuch/Vulgate crap went down.

# Off-camber aside
Well, that `Esq.` part is probly still in contention, but I'm dead, so fuck it. Also, do they spell it 'probly' yet? We always said it that way. And the distinctions among causality, correlativity, and probability were the three-choose-two dilemmas that plagued my waking mind more than any others I can muster.
