# KRRYME

How shall I rebegin?

## Aesthetic

Dark on light or light on dark.

I am now aware of a cosmic syzygy among everything, one, and nothing.

I am a kite. My tail is a string of tiny cataclysms. My heart is the wind.

My mind is fully erect, my wings are taut. They buzz with the shrill intensity of a hungry mosquito.

My feet are jets. Mercury flows through my veins. Titanium gilds my bones. Iron my stomach.

My blood runs hot, but my temper hibernates. What's the most versatile animal?

Booze makes my palms sweaty eventually. Keeping company in my sober state did before.

## Narrative

The intro to my site should be a sentence.

[Code and Theory](http://www.codeandtheory.com/) did a very nice job of this. Mission statement as global nav.
