# What can I do?

## Process optimization

When I find myself repeating anything, I hone and optimize the process so that each result stands a strong chance of being better than the last.

## Front-end web development

I've spent the past five years learning and writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There aren't many developers that know HTML/CSS as well as I do. My JavaScript is elegantly written, but not academically inspiring.

## UX

I have continually found myself advocating for the user, the customer, the client against the stakeholders in a business. I empathize with the user, and relate their needs to those with resources.

## Writing

I know words, like, a lot of words. And I can write them in sentences. Sometimes my sentences make sense. I can edit the crap grammar out of shit other people write. I can tune my voice to my audience. I can lasso a charging donkey from twenty feet out.

## Food and beverages

I can make excellent coffee and cocktails. I can cook up a mess of something delicious using whatever I have on hand. Suggest a dish and I'll research, consolidate, and iterate on the status quo of that dish.

## Befriend a stranger

Trap me in an elevator with anyone. We'll be friends in no time and thereafter. One-on-one I can really draw people in.
