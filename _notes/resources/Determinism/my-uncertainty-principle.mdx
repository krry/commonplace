A future accurately predicted to its participants will cease to be.

No future could be worse than the expected outcome, but luckily no known future can come to be. At least my time-traveling friends say so.

Any imagined future must be incomplete or errant. Otherwise the future has become known and thus present.

Time-paradoxes are the concealed firearms of the narrative.
