# On Iceland

An island nation, or a continent, if you ask them, packed with more epic nature and time-tested fantasy than any other I've been to or heard of. They are so friendly here, and so good at everything they do.

## Striking impressions of Iceland

### The language

They speak a modern form of Norse — one of the great-grandfathers of English — and hold to many of the older meanings of words we now mush and mash with reckless abandon.

**Ivar** is a young Icelander who hails from a village in north of Iceland where many of them fish. He has seen, by his account, indescribable horrors working as an E.M.T. in the streets of Brooklyn and as the same as a Naval EMT in God-knows-where war torn oil-ridden or poppy-producing country. He now works as a deputy at a private security agency (Securitas of Iceland). He claims he can read Beowulf in its original form with little trouble. He regaled me with the cultural and geologic history of the continent during his presence in my life. His girlfriend (Helena?) seemed to enjoy being stoned and not necessarily with anyone. She had some strong indicas on her mind, and Ivar volunteered to share them with us if only we´d crest the hump of the country road that lay between the scree fields under the old volcanoes that made that shoreline upon which the camp and lodge and four-hundred year-old church sat which hosted our ceremony.

Johánn and Salny also sought a different vibe than what the wedding party offered. It was a family party, a mixed crowd, not quite a rager, but brimming with gaiety and revelry. There were speeches and game shows, homemade movies, sing-alongs, audience surveys, and various other microphone-based activities.

Among these various wonders of stage and screen was an hour-long soliloquy by the groom's father. Naturally he spoke in Icelandic. From what little I could glean, he brought to the stage a chimeric performance: part homily, part roast, part polemic. At times the audience roared with laughter, at times they tittered nervously at seemingly edgy jokes, or wept at seemingly poignant admissions. At still other times they sat pensive and respectful as he bellowed out his testament. Or so it seemed to me. I don't speak Icelandic. Or rather, *ég tala ekki íslensku*. Most Icelanders wouldn't have understood my attempts at vocalizing my ignorance. Perhaps you can sound it out and give me the benefit of the doubt.

Ourhay perceived his persona on stage to be quite different from his persona from the day prior when we had first met him at his lovely home in Hafnarfjördur, a town thrice nicknamed by its inhabitants: The Town of Vikings, The Town of Elves, The Town in the Lava. She remarked that he seemed to be playing out some expected role or part in the ceremony. I think it was more of a Jekyll and Hyde situation, that he expressed different sides of his character in different contexts. Either way, his diction reminded me of war propaganda shouted to a seething mob.

Much of our trip to Iceland was a leap of faith. Aníta and Daníel graciously, if not blindly, offered their spare bedroom to us, even on the days before and after their wedding. Upon landing at the airport in Keflavík, we found Aníta there to pick us up. She had rousted herself out of bed at four in the morning to welcome us. We returned to their ample apartment in Hafnarfjördur for the day.

In the early evening we all departed for Lýsuhóll where the wedding party would be camping for the next two nights. Daníel drove the five of us (the bride and groom, their one-year-old son Baltasar, Ourhay and myself) out into the Westfjörds, into Snæfellsnes, a finger of land pointing out into the Atlantic, a finger tipped with a mystical glacier for a nail: Snæfellsjökull.

Our campsite at the wedding consisted of a tent borrowed from the bride's stepfather, so our only sanctuary on the Lysuhóll grounds was something like a vinyl airplane hangar downsized to a four-person tent. He had never pitched this tent. It came bearing spider webs from their cellar or that of the store they sprung it from to unnecessarily pad our arrival. With more or less communication about the environs we might have planned better, but they kept us middling, right in the bitter-spot of indecision. They did not intend to effect this situation for us. We found ourselves there after the witless, aforementioned leap of faith.

On the first night, the tent nearly came down around us in the winds descending from the mountain beneath which we camped. I awoke in sweaty terror at four thirty in the still bright night. The fifty kph winds were buffeting the tent walls beyond my well-deserved dreamscape. I'd been awake for around 36 hours by the time we nestled into our tiny nylon hangar after a long day-night-day-night of travel and vicarious wedding preparation.

On Iceland time we had stayed up until 3:30 am helping the wedding party decorate for tomorrow's festivities, after a sleepless day following an early morning landing preceded by an uproarious bender.

Synopsistically, before I take a breather:
	* Our camping tent at home weighs three pounds and displaces roughly three changes of clothes in a pack.
	* Our sleeping bags are each about a pound, and a change of clothes, or two meals worth of capacity.
	* Our sleeping pads—which we did bring—are together about the same weight as one of our sleeping bags.
	* we have not used the pads
	* we have needed the tent and sleeping bags
	* we have needed but not used the pads
	* the remainder of our trip ought to count on our known supplies
		* no tent - get a shelter
		* no sleeping bags - get blankets
		* no motorcycle - get a mover
		* jetboil - get freeze-dried food and lots of water
		* water filter and Iceland - find a water source
		* energy - Ourhay and I could travel many miles together if we choose to, we can take a long hike, as long as we have a stable home to return to.
		* food
			* harðfiskur and butter will do us well
			* Quest bars and energy drinks will help
			* lots of water
			* fresh veggies and rawish animals wherever possible
			* haven't had hákarl yet, but we will, those sharks be rotten
* hardiness
* capability
	* they have survived a thousand harsh winters together, building customs and practices, culture that led them to today when they find themselves suddenly exposed to the entire globe
* community
* priority - they don't sweat the small stuff
- They are each individually very knowledgeable and capable when it comes to subsistence and survival. Radical self-reliance is taught/learned at an early age.
