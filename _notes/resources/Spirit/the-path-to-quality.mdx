# The Path to Quality

Is the path paved with love and compassion.

A bullet concentrates what we fear. Instant death. No time to prepare for the transition. The path to quality is paved with love and compassion. Quality may be indefinite—as Robert Pirsig has cast it—but it does not lie outside the realm of experimental science. Tom Campbell teases us with consequent methodology. We seek answers. We want them to be personal and verifiable. We need them to be true, Big True.
