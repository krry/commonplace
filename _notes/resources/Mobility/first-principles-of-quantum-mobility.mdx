# First Principles of Quantum Mobility

1. Go from A to B ASAP.
2. Arrive in the same context.
3. Feel no transit.
4. Return easily.
5. Live as you otherwise would.

## Wants/Preferences

- We often want to be somewhere else at that very moment. Teleportation would be nice.
- We want our mobile quality of living to mirror our stationary quality of living: somewhere to recline, to play, to relieve ourselves, and something good to eat.
- If we do travel, we like to feel the ground and the wind, as we do on foot or on bicycles.
- We don't want to experience *placetimes* other than those we desired when we decided to mobilize. Otherwise we would choose to go elsewhere, to those other places along the way.
- We want to understand our environs as we transit, and when we arrive: the language, the cuisine, the culture, and the mores.
- Most of us would rather *be* there than *get* there. Watching hundreds of miles of corn fields blur by on the way to Grandma's house is a drag.
- Bumps in the road do not enhance the arrival experience.
- Powered mobility is difficult to safely comprehend or perform without extensive conditioning and practice, i.e. new drivers/pilots/riders often crash.
- **Sometimes we wish to be here and there at once _and_ are uncertain of our trajectory.**

## Counterpoints Rebutted

- Some of us prefer the journey to the destination. Some of us are Luddite cretins.
- The bumps in the road define our journeys. What the fuck?! Life is not suffering.
- We cannot grow stronger without enduring and conquering strife. But what strength lies in enduring travel in a world where no one has to?
- Arriving without knowledge of your passage is like swallowing a bite of food without tasting or chewing it. Though we needn't always follow our medicine with a spoonful of sugar. Pain is fleeting and best avoided.
- A shoe is the prime device for human transportation. Ideal mobility may require something else entirely.
- A person ought to settle near what is dear, rather than shuttle to and forth. Packing up and moving one's nest is a principally cataclysmic stressor on par with the death of a loved one, commuting far daily, or daylight savings time.
- We've spent so much time, blood, and oil paving our highways, streets, and parking lots. So why don't we better employ them for their intended purposes? Why don't we reboot and readjust to our present possibilities?

## Ancillary inquiries

- What will we do with the some-40% of US Post Office set to lie derelict by 2020? Perhaps we can set up waystations that teach people to post to the web, to the global consciousness, rather than furtively pass each other notes delivered on horseback, in buggies, or by combustion.
- Why do we choose to wear these clothes? Are they crippled proxies for the self-expressions we intend, furthermore tainted by societal apprehensions and last-principle thinkers in the fashion world whose incentives lie in holding us hostage to their next best disposable, mass producible, sweat-shop regurgitations? Perhaps we could dress ourselves in our inner truths by channelling and transforming our personal data into dynamic displays woven into the fabric of our clothes.

Now that you're this far, I hope we're both feeling the love and digging the unity. We should not seek to overturn anything that isn't serving us well, just to supersede it and enable the billions of beautiful minds around us make a better choice.

The two certainties we have could be death and taxes. Or they could be the next breath and the next choice. After a nice deep breath, I am certain that I would choose the latter take.

## Directives

Move our molecules.
Feel what you can.
And treat others well.

Move a lot.
Feel hard.
Love soft.

Be open, feel, and be felt.
