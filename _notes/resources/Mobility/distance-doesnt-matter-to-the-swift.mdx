title: Distance Doesnt Matter To The Swift
---
# Distance Doesnt Matter To The SwiftHow far away is something that doesn't matter if you can get there quickly.

Distance makes less difference as travel gets faster, or less noticeable. Last night we opted to order ice cream from a shop three blocks away, but we asked a Postmate to pick it up and bring it to us. Zero travel time warranted the added cost. We even waited longer to eat the ice cream than we would have if we had chosen to walk there. But instead we got to stay put and enjoy an episode of American Crime Story as the ice cream made its way to us.
