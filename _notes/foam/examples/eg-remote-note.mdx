# Remote MDX Note Example

This is generated from an MDX file that lives outside the `pages` directory of the NextJS app. We can use `next-mdx-remote` to pull in local files from anywhere in the tree, or files from a database or via an API.

MDX, of course, supports elements like <Button>this button</Button>, and ![this image](/doge.jpg).
