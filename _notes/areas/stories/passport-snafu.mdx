# Passport SNAFU

“I came here very early hoping for a minor miracle. My flight to Vancouver is today, at twelve twenty five. I figured out yesterday at 3 pm that my passport recently expired last April. My best friend is getting married. I’m the best man. We’re supposed to fly to Vancouver today. And I found out yesterday my passport is expired when I was digging through my storage unit. I immediately tried to get an appointment with you, but today was all booked. So I called a bunch of passport agents and one of them, a very nice man in Glendale, Armand at Mania’s, he told me I had a chance and gave me the whole rundown on what to do, what to bring, when to arrive, etc. I went to Walgreens right away and got photos. Then I printed my itinerary and a completed DS-82 form. I have my expired passport. And my driver’s license if that helps.”

“Last time I used it was in 2015 when I went to Japan. I did not notice the expiration was coming up. Since then I have moved from San Francisco to 3 different places in LA. So a lot of my stuff has been in boxes. When I found out we were going to Vancouver (that was in April) I started looking everywhere for it. I didn’t think I had time to get a new one. And I didn’t suspect it was expired, but I should have. Time really flies.”

Twenty-two hours before my 12:25 pm flight to Vancouver I tried to check in on the Alaska Airlines website. They informed me that my passport had expired last year. Perhaps the “2017” would have given that away to most homosapiens, but I am a bit unstuck in time. Still the gravity of my predicament was readily apparent. No passport, no Canada. Canada is my favorite place, so I immediately googled around about what to do and found [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov). No appointments at the LA branch of the US Passport Agency were open on that day (it was nearly 3 pm which is when they close) or on the following day when I was hoping to fly.

I broadcast my predicament to the travel posse. A dear friend/polymath/Ironman who had been in a similar situation in LA drummed up potential providers of a same-day passport renewal. The LA Passport Agency (LAPA), a fragment of the State Department housed in the imposing Federal Building in West LA, held my fate in their hands. None of the anecdotes or reviews that I read indicated that they could renew my passport in time for me to catch my flight. But I got busy on my only hope/Obi Wan. I posed for some passport photos at Walgreens, filled out a DS-82 form, and printed that and my international flight itinerary. I  scheduled a Lyft to pick me up so that I would arrive at LAPA at 6 am to plead my (pitifully forgetful) case. And I tried to sleep.

At 2 a.m. I snapped awake in a sweat. My dream had turned lucid and I couldn’t fix the somnolent quagmire. Sleep was no longer welcome, so I started searching around for signs that this passport renewal was at all plausible. That’s when I found Dave’s blog here. I dimmed my phone and locked its orientation so I could read account after account of this working out without waking my bedmate. A few people had gotten appointments that opened up when others seemingly cancelled. I checked the online appointment booker again, and sure enough there were two new slots open. The very earliest ones too: 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. I booked the 7 a.m. slot and arrived at the LA Passport Agency at 6 a.m. as planned.

At 6 a.m. twelve passportless civilians sit on the stone slab benches facing the Will Call windows. Meeting a mother and her Yalie daughter on the walk in, I ask if they have an appointment (they don’t, “does that help?”), so I let them know that I saw one more open this early morning when I booked mine. Daughter was able to claim the 7:30 slot in a few minutes. At 6:10 the staff shuffled over and sorted us into appointment-havers and the chaff. They screened us for proper paperwork according our various situations (new passports need birth certificates, etc.) and sent us along to the Will Call windows that were just opening. The clerk at the window asked what I wanted (“to renew my passport”), then asked for my appointment confirmation number, then for my form, old passport, and photos. She collated all those and gave me a purple laminated card that reads “Overflow Appointment”. I am still not sure what this means. Perhaps it signifies that they opened up extra appointments late last night. It seemed that way. At 6:15 the cafe stand outside the public entrance opened, so I got a fresh hot cuppa coffee. By 6:30 there were 28 civilians and a baby queued up at Will Call.

At 6:45 they filed us behind the red tape near the Public Entrance. At 7 they let some staff and couriers inside. Ten minutes later they beckoned me through the metal detector. My belt, bag, and pocket contents went through a typical x-ray machine. Then I walked straight down the hall to an empty room full of chairs with a dozen or so clerk windows along the left wall.

A lady at a podium outside the room confirmed my appointment by the last four digits of the confirmation number. She gave me a printed ticket with a code on it: G101.

I took my pick of the hundred-some chairs and waited for two minutes until they called me by my ticket code to a window number over the P.A. At the window I met a very nice lady who said I was having a lucky day. I hope she’s a soothsayer. I gave her my materials and let her know I was trying to catch a flight at noonish. She doublechecked with some colleagues and then told me they would do their best to make it possible, but no guarantee because they can’t predict or control any hiccups that might occur in processing. I paid her $170 in cash and she gave me a payment receipt and a will call pickup receipt. “You can check with them starting at 9.” Oh boy, I just might pull this off! No expectations, peace, love, and positivity.

Ten minutes later I heard a wheeled suitcase slap the deck. Its owner had lunged toward the Will Call window at the sound of his name. His passport was ready. His flight to Puerto Vallarta leaves at 10:40 a.m. It is 9:10 and we are 30 minutes from LAX. He just might make it. It’d have to be a LAPA record. We’ll probably never know unless he finds this blog.

Anyway, mine was ready too. I got there at 6 and left at 9:12 passport in hand. $170 and a sleepless night later I was going to Canada!
