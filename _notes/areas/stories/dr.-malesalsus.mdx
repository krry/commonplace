A dream I had on the morning of December 17th, 2006 gave me this idea.

Some suspect he has anterograde amnesia.  The Good Doctor Malesalsus is noticeably perturbed by the recurring interruption to his entourage: an impassible lagoon in the midst of this African plain.

His entourage consists of a hopeless dollface named Celibacy, the sharpest tack in the box in all meanings of the phrase, an utterly vapid Persian seductress,  who loves waterfalls and any flowing water (including golden showers), and K-Fed Connect, her sidekick (looks and acts just like Fred Knecht on nitrous and ecstasy, hey, it's my dream).
