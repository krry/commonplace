A soul within a person was once in another creature.

Our souls carry the deepest learnings of our past lives.

Some creatures now bear the former souls of people.

Species of creatures that have survived longer have done so through wealth of soul.

Wealth of soul compounds as souls inhabit the similar creatures for more, consecutive, or successive lives.

Species of creatures all have consciousness. The filters of sensation and perception of a creature mold its consciousness.

Existential bewilderment stems directly from the transience of the soul.

The conscious mind seeks to grok the soul that animates it and the body that holds it.

Qualia, purely subjective, conscious experiences through our senses and perception, assemble to form our conception of reality.
