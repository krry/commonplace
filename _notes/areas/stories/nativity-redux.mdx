# Nativity Redux

Some guy creeks through the door of your inn. "Do you perchance have a room this evening? My lady is laden with fetus and we have been hurriedly fleeing town all day into the desert. The brightest star in the sky led us here."

You have no vacancy. It's been a busy night, what with the sun setting so much earlier and the winds growing colder.

"Well, I'm plumb booked, but y'all can crash in the manger if'n yer swolled up lass can abide the hay."

Joe takes what he can get. Carpenters can't be beggars.
