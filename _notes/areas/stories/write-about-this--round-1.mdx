## Round 1

    You swerve to avoid a squirrel. Unknown to you, the squirrel pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the squirrel arrives…

There's a scratchy little tap on my front door. I look up from my iPad, glance at the Game of Thrones re-run replaying on the big screen, and flit my eyes toward the door. _Not expecting anyone. Not windy outside._

I frisbee the iPad onto the couch and bound out of my chair toward the door. I hear claws skitter across the concrete porch. Little claws.

Opening the front door, I see nothing out of the ordinary except a bushy tail exposing itself from behind the awning post.

> Hey there, little guy, what's up?

This is where it got weird.

In my head, I suddenly felt—no, heard—a voice, a bit Alvin, a bit Simon, a bit more Theodore.

> Come with me if you want to live!

I nearly jumped out of my skin and emptied my bowels all in one take.

## Round 2

    You have a special type of clairvoyance: you can see the outcomes of all possible choices. You use this power to become a superhero that fights crime by making the smallest possible changes ahead of time. You are the  Butterfly.

> Greetings, I am the Butterfly. You are here because I intended you to be here. That birthday cake in front of you was delivered this morning. I didn't order it. Instead the baker at the new cupcake shop around the corner had a dream last night about you, about your 45th birthday. It seemed extremely important to her, she awoke in a cold sweat and couldn't rest her mind until she had baked that cake, this cake.

> All this is to say. Don't FUCK with me. And happy motherfucking BIRTHDAY, you old sack o' shit!

_Well, I… I just don't know what to say… The Butterfly? I thought your name was Randal. I just don't. I can't._

> It's alright, Gramps, no one gets it right away. And once they get it, no one wants to believe it.

## Round 3

    Jupiter has 64 moons and a serious werewolf problem.

"These soggy milkbones are just NOT OKAY," thought Jupiter. "I've had it with this. I was better off at the pound."

Jupes kicks some dirt over the soggy mess to prevent future temptations. The moon—well, one of them—is rising, and the hunger is too. Lil' Jupey Poopy is 'bout to prowl.

He can see "Thomas" and his cunty wife Melanie silhouetted on the living room wall as they irradiate their pupils with ultraviolet in the wee hours in the form of _Naked & Afraid_ re-runs.

Then the moons shift, feels like 23, 6, and 57 tonight. "Sums to 86. Good year," Jupe pontificates, as the bloodlust takes him over.

## Round 4

    Instead of a dystopia that seems like a utopia on the surface, write a story about a utopia that seems like a dystopia on the surface.

The breeze smells like fish.
I've eaten fish for every lunch and dinner all week.
Always the same fish, the others aren't around anymore.

My shoulders are sore from work.
That boulder never gets lighter, never smaller.
Gravity never gets easier, never lessens its pull.

And Zeus. I know he's watching me.
If I hadn't locked up his big bro, I wouldn't be here.
They fucked with my woman, and my woman fucked with me, and now I'm here.

But hey, everybody needs something to do.
This is my path, and I'm okay with that.
I feel contentment having something to master.

I love this life. I feel strong. I feel purpose.
In the eyes of some, I may toil. But I bliss as I do.

## Round 5

    You obtain a device that tells you exactly what choices to make in order to lead the "happiest" life possible. Some of these choices get hard to make.

"Fucking **kill her**, Jerry!"

Your head rings like a belfry inhabited by a gyrating, sledgehammer-wielding hunchback.

Your palms are sweaty on the machete handle. You don't know how you got here, but you kinda do, I mean, if you really think about, you did do all those things, you did kill all those people, you swung the axe, you pulled the trigger. _But why?_

As far as you can tell, the voice started on the 29th of June in twenty-fifteen. It's been building steam, that's for sure. Everything seemed a little odd after the 29th. Little whispers would sneak in when neighbors popped over. When the kids would wail or holler, you heard a snicker in the background. When your husband bellowed at you from the front room, weezing and farting, about something you'd already taken care of without his help or attention, you heard the voice pronounce **its first order**.

## Round 6

    A demon writes messages on your mirror with blood, but they're useful messages. Like: "remember you have yoga at 6 tonight".

Every since Rob Zombie became the President and CEO of Apple Computer, the iVerse has been thinking differently. I mean, thinking different, sorry Steve. The retinal blood display turned out to be a real nightmare.

But the iCU was a horse of a different color. It harkened back to Snow White: a mirror that saw the future, that stroked my ego. "I _see_ youuuuu", it would sing as I walked in the bedroom.

Still, I couldn't get over the aesthetic u-turn they had made. From clean, sparkling crystal in iOS 45 to bloody, meat mess in iOS 46. It made no sense.
