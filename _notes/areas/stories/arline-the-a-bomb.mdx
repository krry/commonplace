# Arline was the bomb

Richard may have found a love more complex than even he could understand. And when he lost her, hundreds of thousands had to die. Clearly, Arline was the bomb.

You see, there is a theoretical force between quarks within a hadron that grows exponentially stronger as those quarks are torn apart by collisions in the world's most powerful particle accelerators. There are subatomic particles so quantumly entangled that they mirror changes in each others' spin at speeds faster than light. And there were two bombs that fell upon Japan that have irrevocably changed humanity's relationship with technology. Perhaps Arline can enlighten us as to what all this means.

Richard and Arline started out beautifully. Dick was a promising young scientist; Arline was the prize of her town, and quite possibly the spark—the muse—that unlocked Richard's budding brilliance. But Arline soon took ill.
