Squirrel awoke, pawed the previous night's dirt off his nose, and wriggled to surface. Terrence squawked. "Terrence is such a cunt," thought Squirrel, eyeing him from a distance, interrupting the sun's lazy rise with his squinting gaze.  He disregarded the old crow's misguided voice.

Terrence had been up for hours, long before the sun. A crow's nights are short and its days are long. Terrence craved nuts like few creatures have. Squirrel had the nuts to patrol.

The sun warmed Squirrel's back as he prepared breakfast: shuffling to the kitchen, shoveling through the fridge, shucking a husk or two from their prior foragings. Terrence oversaw the proceedings, saliva divining its way down his jealous maw's beak.

A murder is a difficult thing to reconcile. Terrence tried every morning with little luck. Some are born into a murder, others end up committing one. The same feathers that might breathe softly and grant us loft can collect dust and deaden our flight.

Terrence convulsed and coughed to expel his murder's dusty detritus. It might be time to fly. This murder held no guilt, no shame. Terrence contemplated a different clutch. He loosened his grip as Squirrel's pate glistened. His raw song erupted, "Hey, you furry quadroped."

Squirrel stiffened instinctively, then shat a little into a chute well-planned to catch his tumblings and turdlings within the dwelling below.
