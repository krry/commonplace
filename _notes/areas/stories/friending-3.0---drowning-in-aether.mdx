# Friending 3.0

Some stack of muscle surprises you with a toothy grin as he summons your ID. This show is going to be epic, you understand. The bass resonates in your feet as you trip on the stoop. A soft yellow-green pulses within the seething, soon-roaring mass. The Chartreuse Pulse has infested the crowd inside.

Six weeks ago you met Camphor. "My true-trues call me 'Cam'," he'd fadedly quote-jacked. His pendant had drawn you in: pulsing, glowing, flashing. It lay buried in his… tunic?

Cam knew Enz: "We're old friends. I knew the Enzyme back in high school." He might have been peacocking, preschooling, but it worked. Flashy feathers like those don't go unnoticed. I felt drawn; it was an obvious encounter, given the Zeit and the moon and shit.

## We start with these obvious truths.

The Chartreuse Pulse had been an intense part of your life since Cam swung through. Cam wasn't even a romantic interest. His clubstink reminded you of a vacation survival. Snorkel a beach in Belize? Why not? Those [Ozzies](aussies as ozzies link) had been led to profess that these in Belize have a splendid reef. You, meanwhile, had contemplated hygeine and researched the latest studies on pheromones in re love. You're on top of this. Cam smells of cabbage and bivalves, though his pendant would never admit that.

The Chartreuse Pulse dubbed themselves Charters like their pants were loaded unexpectedly in a socially unescapable fever dream. Dolly belted one out: "Shar-truce". The appellation felt right: soft-C, like Cher, and a feigned devil-may-care attitude whipped into a confusingly literate origin story that burrows itself under the biggest rock in California until the Feds turn your pinko/universal Understanding ass into a pocket of pico de gallo with a haplessly tossed teargas canister into your prospection exploitives. Kaboom! I'm Shart Bruce, bitch!

The fed raid of the German under the rock may never be righted. But the Orgasmatron still stands. Did I pronounce that right? Intellitron? It's not phallic. It's a dome that off-Earth minds designed: it breeds integrity, I intuit. These off-Earth minds had found their way here after all. Why not believe them?

## The Integratron. I want to know what he knew.

This is an simple impulse, felt by the intentionally isolated mind. We'll get there. I know because I have met my complement. Her name is Ourhay. She embodies happiness. She is one-of-a-kind. Singular: the 'ONLY' with which I've been sloppily tagging San Francisco. McCoppin is a dirty, dirty place: the dirtiest I've come across.

You have now Charted (soft-C) your way up and down one hyphy western seaboard for a grip, for a dog's age, for long enough to know when to clench and when to rip.

But instead you let 'er rip with the Charters, and all the base are now belong to you. "Side with the non-judgmental types", your Dad had once secreted. "They expect less. Happier cunts."

## Then you faced a mob of _wilkommen_

The beat rode under your approach to the abyss. Quiet steps—given the thumping din—tapped under your carefully Zappoed bootheels. Cam was around here somewhere. Cam and the Fam.

You strode to the epicenter. Why? Because the beat drew you there.

Search-light whites blind your outlook: blinding white floods your retinae from right to left.

Now you're here, flooded. Your husband is a careful rapist. Your paramour cares fully. I love you like Moby loves the depths and Ishmael hates spears. I love you like ninety-six hours of sleeplessness and.
