# Uglily: Ramscuttle

Years ago a ram tried to kill me.
It kicked loose a ton of stone.
The trail shook before me.
I knee-jerked my neck up to the sheer cliff above our path.
I'm telling an old story and trying so hard to tell it truly.

Andy led our hiking troop of four.
For millennia, steep crags had held high hopes
and then crumbled into the stream below
which tributed the Colorado River.
We walked a narrow path along the tributary,
just a boot-width aside a stream ten feet below to our left.
