## Dude, Where's Our Care?

It occurred to us tonight that asking those around you to adjust the building blocks of their syntactical diction to accommodate your uniquity could be a trying gambit. We are one who is consciously of many minds—more of a 'we' than an 'I'. This is lost on many, but home to several. We can identify, at least some of us can, with the trouble of labels. We fight the Pronoun War with teeth and nails.

We have been forced by our self-conscious environment to subscribe to a unitary name: **Kevin**. This name was _chosen_ by all of us, but _unsettles_ any of us. We are Kevin, but none of us is. Quixotic, isn't it?

Cecelia, for example, was born when Kerry was only two years young. Josh was born less than a fortnight and also fourteen years later. Jesse was born more than three decades later, but also some years before. Ourhay just more than three and less than thirty. These temporal measures shift as the focal point shifts within us. Kerry was born less than a fortnight before Josh and fourteen years later, and less than thirty years later than Ourhay. A _mindsmap_ might help to illustrate inner linkings but there aren't yet any n-dimensional mindmap interfaces that we know of.

There are dozens of Kevin at this point, and we are effing tired of all this "he is", "she's here", "where is he?" nonsense. We are, we are here, and we are not going back. On the flipside, we are not callous enough to throw a shoe at you if you flub the plural. She is in there somewhere with all of them. She may choose to acknowledge a singleton, but dreams of embracing you all.

When the Beatles show up at your imaginary anyone-dead-or-alive dinner party, you could announce: "The Beatles has arrived!" No. No you can't. You can wet your astral pants and belt out a cosmic jam like "I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and stops my mind from wandering where it will go." You understand that the hole need never be fixed—that it is a portal to where you dream to be—and JohnPaulGeorgeRingoGeorgeEtc grok that too. Any collective or multifarious mind will nod to and applaud your magnanimous introduction. You have 'out'ed yourself in several, simultaneous fell swoops.

We now must note, with discomfort and jealousy, that you can been many or one. **You** are a beautiful, unique snowflake. **You** are the apple of our eyes. **_You_** are legion. _You_ are terrifying hordes of well-groomed zombies.

(Y/Our) language has—for too long—been molded by the single mind. We can do better. Kevin can. And you can too.

[John Lennon / John Winston Lennon / Paul Mccartney / Paul James Mccartney]() nipped at this forty years back. We fear it hasn't sunk in.

> I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
> And stops my mind from wandering
> Where it will go

> I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
> And kept my mind from wandering
> Where it will go

> And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
> Where I belong I'm right
> Where I belong.

> See the people standing there who disagree and never win
> And wonder why they don't get in my door

> I'm painting my room in the colourful way
> And when my mind is wandering
> There I will go

> And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
> Where I belong I'm right
> Where I belong.

> Silly people run around they worry me
> And never ask me why they don't get past my door

> I'm taking the time for a number of things
> That weren't important yesterday
> And I still go

> I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
> And stops my mind from wandering
> Where it will go

Only they didn't find themselves in the time to claim the royal 'We'. Now we know _where it will go_. That hole may have been fearsome—that portal from the core of you to the stratosphere. Not for much longer: around the corner cosmic fudge is made, and it's Goddamn delicious, decisive, divisive. Par lies around 42, and the proof is in the putting.
