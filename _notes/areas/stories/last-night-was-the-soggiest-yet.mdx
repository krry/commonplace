# Last night was the soggiest yet

She wouldn't stop. I didn't expect her to. I'm just far too strung out to expect anything.

It's been a year. We've tried everything. My hands are softer than a lonely trucker's with all the baby oil. And I haven't slept in (what day is it?) longer than I can remember. I just read half of the summary of the excerpt of an article about a study which concluded that REM sleep is integral to memory retention. Don't recall where I saw it.

All I can do these days is tap at these keys and wait for the next needful wail. She's got us running shifts. Only, her schedules dissolve indecipherably in _ad hoc_ pools of bodily fluid. They come out of nowhere and end up there. The most I can do is shield the room from the spray. Terry cloth has outperformed microfiber towels, hands down, hands up, no hands. Overall.

The odor is manageable. We open the windows to let the breeze flow through the house while we refill the Britas and empty the laundry baskets. In the back of my mind, I feel a fuzzy flash of something about gray water vs. black water. Not even the clear water is potable. We still have to run it through a filter before consumption. So if all these types of water are tainted, why distinguish?

Anyway, do you know any good lullabyes? Ones that work consistently night after night for kids or grownups or psychotically howling creatures, because I'm running out. Phase Three comprised renditions of T-Pain freestyling Biggie verses as Daft Punk hooks. It worked a few times, a bit better than Phase Two. Phase Two was a tribute tour: Barney sings Junior Kimbrough, Robert Johnson, and Barry Manilow. Meet me in the city, meet me at the crossroads, meet me in Copa Cabana for all I care, as long as we're both unconscious.

I first met Filona about seven months ago. They talk about those singular folks that you can't ignore. We hear tell of _deja vu_. Those eerie moments routinely become commonplace when we soliloquize on a particular variety of organism.

"Wait, didn't I just?"
…
"But that was in high school."
…
"That felt real as fuck."
…
"Okay I get it, you're a witch."
…
"Eternal respect, I'll just go fetch a shrubbery."

Filona knows all the lines, but she rarely recites them. She runs the anchor leg of all our medley relays: freestyles defiantly, always last in the pool, never finishes last. Admittedly, no one runs their legs, and no one shows up for the starter pistol. But Filona wins every week, barnone.

I have only just begun unpacking her strategy. The sleep deprivation has stunted my progress. When I signed up for this I didn't anticipate such a somatic impact. I didn't train for this; just filled out the form and squirted back to work. This treatment is outright and downright unwelcome.

Last week I awoke to something palatable. I could taste the blood of my own flesh being boiled by a banshee's shriek emanating from within my meager domicile. The muzzle must have slipped off. I slap-checked my flanks and limbs. No real damage. Just some tired _imaginjuries_.

Take a never-nap and that _portmanteau_ may make more sense. I'm not writing riddles here, just letting my mental mice run on these slippery keys as my torturer snores. So let's dig in a bit, shall we? I'm bucking, chomping, at the proverbial bit. Tame a wild horse, you insufferable cur. Bridle your narrator. Or hear me out. I promise you something unforgettable.

# She lays to rest

It's hard to dig the blues without a spurned lover in your rearview, or a lover who spurned you in your missed calls. Steve Miller introduced to me to Robert Johnson. He doesn't know that he did that. BMG steered me to some fabricated compilations of the greatest hits of the greatest bands.

    You better come on
    into my kitchen
    because it is go'n' to be rainin' outdoors.

# Phase Four: Massage
