# Why am I writing Birdie?

## I like the concept, many others have grokked/liked it right away

> A man trapped in his home with a bird that won't shut up. His friends don't understand her. He doesn't particularly like her, but he stays there with her, supports her. He does what he can to reconcile his situation with his friends.

The concept for this narrative first flew into my head in the middle of a 5,000-mile motorcycle trip with a man who had just lost his father and his father's long-time best friend. I'm still compelled to write it, though the personal situation that likely compelled it to surface is long since gone from my life. Perhaps I was the birdie, perhaps I was the man, perhaps both. I don't trust my mind to construct sensical metaphors these days.

It occurs to me that many men in the U.S. will empathize with his situation. What I'd like to explore is whether I can write Birdie to be the heroine.

## Broader sociological goals

There are a few societal tides in our American times I might change or point out.

### Be nice, not good or bad: it's not that simple

Fundamentalist morals and norms have left too many intelligent minds wallowing in stagnant pools of routine and ritual, afraid to express their truths in our new era of information surplus—wherein anything is suddenly possible to know and make known.

### Slow the hurry: we'll get there together.

Technological development cannot outpace users' understanding of the value or benefit of the technology, until the technology understands its own value. We have the choice to slow the hurry, to tune our pace of development to our aggregate flux of understanding. But we won't have that choice for long.

### We are one gem: many facets, many spectra, one crystal structure.

Our collective concepts of sanity, gender, and sexuality are coming of age in our new era of communication surplus—wherein we can talk to nearly anyone else in the world synchronously or asynchronously. Our differences are becoming more clear, as are our similarities. I would posit that more self-truths have been shared in the last decade than in the prior century.

### Mating is the oldest game—one we can learn to play better.

Darwin and Dawkins often looked to the birds for insights regarding our mating habits and their deeper meanings. To explain our existences as survival machines housing selfish genes, Dawkins constructed many of his analogies and examples around archetypical birds: doves and hawks, etc. Darwin discovered many of the deeper truths of organic ethics while bird-watching. Crafting an accessible narrative of bird-like characters that embody these all-too-little-known mating strategies could help to bring spirit to their scientific endeavors.

### Timelessness is not oblivion, it is enlightenment.

Alan Watts and Richard Feynman, among many with whom I'm not as familiar, understood that our minds can be subject to time, or choose not to be. Feynman saw time as having a quantum duality. A collision of particles is as defined by its results as its origins—each collision could not have happened any other way. Given an event, Watts might tell us *this event has always happened*. Entanglement between particles is not a burden, it is a truth, outside of time. Are we the puppets of the past—or cogs in the cosmic machine—driven along but something that is behind us? Or are we parts of a comedy of nonsense, playing our roles, able to enjoy them?

## Memes are the new genes

Nature has a way of binding unique beings together into stronger, stranger beings. Two strong genes in the same corpus can conspire and mutually benefit. Two strong memes can do the same: try "Charlie Bit My Finger" and "David After Dentist": both about kids figuring out what this oral stage of life means. Then take a thriving gene and a thriving meme. Are they that different? Or are they potentially complimentary? And if so, what would one call this new unit? I call it a *teme*.
