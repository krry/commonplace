# How to make Birdie

1. Write a short story. Keep it open on your screen.
2. Tell it to everyone. Take their feedback.
3. Always continue research. Review, read, relax.
4. Keep copious, but organized, notes. Write everyday.
5. Construct character personas, draw/paint settings, outline plots.
6. Meet with people that can help tie things up.
7. Publish strategically. Blog frequently about the process.
