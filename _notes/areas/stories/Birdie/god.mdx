# Does Birdie believe in God?

Birdie does. She believes in the God we will all become one day. The God we already are but often fail to recognize in ourselves.

> "We must all have faith in something, Miss Crane. We cannot see ahead alone."
- Trade Minister Tagomi addressing Julianna Crane

The God we need resides in each of us as a shard, a seed. This God is one and many. It repeats our great kindnesses, and allows to pass our missteps and mistakes. This God is non-special, non-gendered, non-sexual, non-raced, non-religious (but not agnostic).

Birdie's God repairs her when she sleeps. It enriches her and warms her when she is awake. It inspires her, and conspires with her. Birdie's God is at times benevolent, and often ambivalent.

Birdie's God was once known to be a simple rock in a lake beneath a mountain. At least part of it was. That small part of it was. Because Birdie knows something  few of us do. She knows that all the swimming particles gathering into absurdities and exchanging energy among them—and around and through her—they are all God. Birdie knows little else, nor need she.

Birdie's grace is a lovely little ditty. One note. One song. *Gratia*
