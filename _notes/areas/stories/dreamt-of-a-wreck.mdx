TIFU by sending it back where it came from

I'm still shaking a bit from this.  You won't like why.

Last night, I attended my buddy's dad's funeral. I haven't known Roger (my buddy) that long, but we have one of those connections that is older than either of us. Kind of weirds you out, but you're its junior, so you let it have its way most of the time. 

Anyway things wrapped up and we—Roger and his brother and myself—went to the parking lot to find our cars. My girlfriend had already taken our car, and several of our friends, back to Roger and his wife's place, so I followed Roger and his bro their vehicle.

We had an uneventful ride. Shot the shit about how to maintain solid traction when cornering at speed, cornered at speed, took the freeways home. And then we hit traffic, just at the low point of an underpass, really close to home. It was sudden, but that's not unusual near where he lives.

What was unusual was seeing the backend of the tractor-trailer in front of us bucking a car-height into the air as it slammed back and forth against the left and right cement guard walls that guided our path up the off-ramp to Roger's neighborhood. The car in front of us skidded to a halt just underneath the back tires of the bucking trailer as we stopped just shorter and jettisoned the vehicle.

Roger booked it off the road, and up an emergency ladder to the right of the sunken roadway. I couldn't see the street above from as low as we were, but I instinctively sprinted after him. Roger's fast, the kind of guy you trust when things are happening fast. I didn't even think twice. I could hear his brother's boots clapping the pavement behind me when I reached the ladder.

When I was halfway up I turned around to look for Connor (Roger's brother). He had stopped down in the freeway. There were a few other people down there, standing between wrecks. And one guy laying on the ground, on his side, like he'd been thrown there. His arm was clearly broken. His jacket was green, worn fatigues. I heaved myself up the ladder violently.

When I was about 20 feet off the deck and two rungs from the top I heard something below. A rush and a whistle that made me jerk my head to follow it, but so fast I missed its source. The people below were frantic, scattering, some looking at the sky above me. As I followed their eyes upward I felt a hard tug on the bottom of my hoodie, like somebody had grabbed the front pocket and was trying to yank me off the ladder.

I thrashed my right hand down toward whatever had seized me, and pulled hard upward with my left, popping my eyes up to street-level. I caught a glimpse of Roger as he darted into his house. Instead of someone's hand clutching me, I found a heavy object in my hoodie pocket. A rock, with smooth patterned ridges I could feel through the fabric. Here's where I fucked up.

Lightning went through me. I grabbed what my right hand was touching (the zipper of my hoodie) and ripped upward. The grenade dumped out of my pocket, down the ladder, down to the people on the freeway, down to the wrecks. Down to the guy with the busted arm that had haphazardly fired his dying armament into my hoodie pocket. Down to Roger's brother.

All the blood in my body found my arms. I threw myself up onto Roger's street as it went off. At least Roger had made it to the house, to his wife, to my girlfriend. And then I woke up quivering on the carpeted floor of my apartment at six this morning, having bodily heaved myself out of bed.

Now, before you slam that downvote, let me say one thing. I don't know how RPGs work. Ok, two things. If the head of my bed had been facing the wall like a normal person's bed would be, I might have broken my neck. That's how hard I threw myself up the ladder/out of bed. Instead I woke up when I hit the floor, shaking, horrified at what I had done. Why didn't I throw it aside? Why did I just send it back where it came from? Tonight I fucked up.
