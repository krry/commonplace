## A Rough Plot Outline

- Open in a familiar setting with an uncanny glow, a spectre in the periphery.
- The place is here. Set in the place that I currently am while writing. For instance, on a plane, as I am now.
- The time is also now, as it always is. We won't pay any attention to eras or periods. Unstuck in time. See notes on Slaughterhouse Five.
- The rest is wild abandonment.
