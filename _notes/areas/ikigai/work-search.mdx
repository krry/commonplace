# Where to Be of Service

### Intent

As we evolve beyond the story of Separation into a world of Interbeing and abundance, we will reexamine, adapt, and jettison many of the premises on which our civilization, culture, and especially business depend. I will be of service to those who have the courage to usher in this gentle revolution.
