# A Personal Evaluation

While taking the 8values quiz ([my results](https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=68.9&d=86.7&g=68.1&s=64.2)) after the PolitiScales quiz ([my results](http://www.politiscales.net/en_US/results/?j0=36&j1=36&e1=31&e0=45&s1=29&s0=50&t1=52&t0=26&b1=5&b0=76&m0=21&m1=26&c1=48&c0=33&p0=57&p1=17&prag=100)), it struck me that I want to assemble a survey that goes one layer deeper than politics or the personality, one that sculpts an image of the person, that maps the facets of one's identity. I wonder if, in 50ish standardized questions, we can get to the bottom of what constitutes a person, in a person's own estimation, and illustrate the fluctuations in our opinions from personal spectrum to identifying quality. Am I on another fool's errand? Likely. It's kinda my M.O.

## Spectra of the Self

Matter - body, stuff, guts, brain, blood, dust
Intellect - reason, logic, thought, cogitando
Awareness - consciousness, light, attention, intent
Sentience - feeling, emotion, presence

## The Questionnaire

This will take some iteration, so let's begin.

We'll start by formulating statements with which the subject can agree or disagree, fully or partially, or demur.
