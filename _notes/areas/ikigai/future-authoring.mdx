# Future Authoring

## One Thing You Could Do Better

I want to inspire better. My aspirations are plentiful, broad, and tower into the cosmos. But my ability to inspire pales in comparison. I often inspire myself to make choices free of prejudice or the taint of dogma, but I fail to inspire myself to alter habits that fail to serve me. Others often view my lifestyle and motivations with an air of disbelief, but I fail to inspire them to follow my lead. Probably because I have royally fucked up my life.

The ability to inspire can take several forms: demonstration, communication, persuasion, compassion, courage. Ideally I will inspire by being. Authenticity seems a direct path to effortless inspiration. However the path to authenticity meanders through fog and flora. A compound approach may yield the best results as I grow.
So I will hone my being, polish my message, tune my voice, open my heart, and perfect my dance. Perhaps inspiration lies not in doing anything in particular, but in presenting truth and love to any and every observer.

## Improve Your Habits

Practice makes perfect.

I want to improve my ability to organize and channel reading and research into well-distilled, well-crafted writing.

Each day I want to enter and maintain a flow state where I produce meaning that others value enough to support me.

I want to recognize the deepest needs of my loved ones, and put them before all of my needs except for my one deepest need.

I want to listen more closely to my body when making choices that will impact its operation. I want to ingest only substances that propel me toward a higher quality of consciousness.

## Your Social Life in the Future

My friends get me. I have met a lot of new people in the past several years. Thanks to a few key questions that I ask, I have been able to quickly identify the ones with open minds, healthy skepticism, and a fervor for continuous, conscious improvement.

Many of my friends devote time to Atmanautica, adding value where they choose and how they are well-suited to contribute depending on their passions and skills they develop.

We carefully establish, develop, and maintain trust. We share and hone compassion, forgiveness, patience, honesty, and generosity to quell and ease the fears we experience.

We admit and expose our beliefs and the beliefs others hold. We do not fear ignorance, but rather we embrace it and explore it hand in hand. We seek personal growth, but do not concern ourselves with needs and wants that serve our egos. We strip our own egos down, and lovingly and firmly encourage others to join us in our fearless nakedness.

I do not have to hold court, or cut people off, or shout, or whisper. We respect each other, and listen more than we speak. We come from love and live in love.

## Your Leisure Activity in the Future

My whole life is leisure. I do not work. Much of my leisure yields meaning that others value enough to support my bodily needs. Not working gives me the space to maintain a quiet, clear mind so that the meaning I produce comes easily and swiftly.

I write, I create, I collaborate, I build. We craft processes, apparatuses, meals, community. We teach new entrants and learn from everyone.

I rest and play enough to balance my mind and body. I do not rush or hurry or worry or stress about anything. I sleep until my dreams wind up. I play until my body is warm and glowing. I make love and dance with the same free spirit of expression and compassion. I practice yoga and meditation with a patient yen for mastery.

My leisure time rarely involves consumption or spectating. Instead I explore, compose, express, contemplate, and communicate.

## Your Family Life in the Future

My parents have begun a new phase in their life together in Iowa. They live an easy life with their dogs and cat. They are free to make choices that bring them joy and they support each other to do so without fear or resentment.

My sister and her husband have set up a new life in Iowa as well. Carl teaches topics he loves exploring to kids that appreciate his energy and brilliance. Allie teaches teachers how to shed the dogma that keeps them mediocre. She may have kids, in which case she is the best mom she can be. Carl is the best dad he can be.

I have been careful in my search for a new partner. We approach each other without fear or ego. We can talk about anything whether we agree or disagree. Our anger dissolves into humor. We smile easily at each other. There are no lies between us. She is beauty embodied and growing more so. We may have children together. We want for nothing because we have appraised our needs and wants fully and together to set a plan for the future.

I spend more time with my family than I used to. I know when to part ways and when to return. Things are easy for us because we speak more truly and love more openly. My family is growing and improving.

## Your Career in the Future

I do not have a career.

I produce meaning that others value enough to support me. I have the courage to ask the hard questions and to find the answers. I have the compassion and open-minded skepticism to include whoever will help in my explorations.

I do not worry about money, insurance, security, status, or interest. I only do what I want to do and the things that support my ability to do what I want.

## Qualities You Admire

I admire great writers who have developed the diligence to create coherent works of great depth and breadth. I admire great thinkers who identify and slice through dogma and beliefs.

I admire those who love without ego and interact with unlimited compassion.
I admire my Sister. She is wise and loving and open and fun.
I admire my Dad. He is humble and selfless and responsible and stoic. I admire my Mom. She is caring and selfless and generous and strong.
I should aspire to find more people I admire and get to know them personally. I should seek to provide for their needs and offer them compassion, open heart and open ears.

## The Ideal Future

I awaken. I take a deep breath and close my eyes tightly then open them wide. The sun is up, beaming into the room. I stretch my body in a series of movements I have practiced each morning to limber myself out of still slumber. I make my bed as I leave it.

I stand and move through another brief series of movements, breathing mindfully as blood and energy flows through my core and out to my extremities. My partner follows a similar ritual in the morning that suits her body's needs. She may rise before me or after me. We are kind and quiet as we rise to respect the value of dreaming.

I collect my thoughts, recalling the intentions I set the night before as I lay to rest. I eat what will sustain my morning's activities. I ingest the nutrients that will help my body heal and strengthen. I take in the compounds that will support my brain's efficient operation. I hydrate and expel waste and wash and groom.

My intentions for today involve my loved ones and my passions. I do not work, but I do spend much of my time generating meaning that others value. The time I spend otherwise supports my ability to generate meaning: play for joy, exercise for strength, agility, and flexibility, meditation for clarity, patience, and compassion, gardening, gathering, harvesting, cooking for nourishment to fuel my ambitions.

My mother rarely experiences neuralgia. My father adventures when he pleases. My sister channels her love and compassion to grateful recipients. Her husband knows his worth and directs his creativity and truth to grateful students. They support each other with open hearts, arms, ears. They may have children. We all love each other fearlessly and fully.

I remember feeling anger, frustration, and disappointment, but I rarely feel these ways anymore. I am patient with myself and everyone I encounter. I have no expectations, no wants, few needs or desires (only those that serve to grow the quality of my consciousness). My ego is all but nonexistent. Others recognize this. I feel fearful at times. But I have no fears I have not identified and confronted. Some of these fears are new, few are old, and those are fears I share with loved ones. We confront those fears with mutual courage and compassion.

My mind is open. My heart is open. My eyes and ears are open. My arms are open. My mouth is open, but less so than my ears.
I write. My words are true. My language is simple. I publish my writing without fear or greed.

I have studied the Tao, Hindu, and Yoga. I can practice yoga without a guide leading me through the positions aloud. I have a guide within me. I know quite a bit of Sanskrit, Chinese, and Japanese. I draw from ancient and fresh wisdom to guide my choices, words, and actions. I share this wisdom with others, and hearing it they pursue their own wisdom more fervently.

I have long hair and a short beard, well coifed. I am lean and strong. I can bend and jump and bounce and lift and throw and catch and run and swim. I transport myself under my own power most of the time. I share rides.

Few of my friends work. They have learned how to produce meaning and value joyfully and flowingly as well. We cook and eat together, sharing meals and stories and ideas. We do not gossip. We argue playfully when we disagree. We acknowledge that we are each drops of the ocean and the whole ocean in single drops. We share consciousness and everything else.

I have enough clothes to wear. They are not a costume, but a true expression of comfort, function, and elegance. I may live on a boat, or on a farm, or in a cabin, or in a city.

We do not want for money. I have settled my debts.

My partner is my favorite person and I am hers. We strive to continue to be each other's favorite. We love each other wholly and communicate only truth. We propel and guide each other on the path of growth of quality of consciousness.

## A Future to Avoid

I can't believe this is my life. I have royally fucked this up.

I thought I had all the answers, so I stopped asking questions. I built this company, Atmanautica, to help us explore how we got here and what to do about it. But now we are too distracted by all the petty aspects of running and growing a company to focus on the mission we agreed upon.

Our investors demand profits, metrics, reports. They have tied us down with promises, expectations, and wants. We have dissolved our egos so effectively that we have allowed ourselves to become subject to the egos of others who refuse to join us in letting go.

We are in debt. I am in debt. I worry all the time about how to fulfill the promises others have compelled me to make under duress and manipulation. I trusted too many people too fully. I was not brave enough to defend our vulnerable open interests from the fears and beliefs others hold dear.

Looking back I can identify the times I failed to lead with resolve in my compassion. I overvalued listening and failed to speak up. I knew better and chose to let others drive in hopes that they would be able to learn the impact of their choices and make better ones in the future. I let others have agency for my well-being, and did not take responsibility for myself.

Worse still I showed others (my family, friends, colleagues, compatriots, mentors, and proteges) that I was capable of helping them and then allowed them to rely on me more than they rely on themselves for their well-being. I feel crushed under the weight of their expectations. I have not taught them well.

My body is tired. My mind is busy. I rarely rest. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to depend on, including myself. I am alone.

## My Main Goal

### Quality through Understanding and Unity

I follow the epiphanies of others to a deep holistic understanding of how I got here and what to do about it. I share my understanding with everyone who will listen. I do not want, need, expect, worry, hurry, rush, harm, or waste. I channel my attention and intention toward the growth of the quality of my consciousness, and by doing so openly and compassionately I inspire others to grow as well.

## Goals I Want to Achieve

### Attend all living things and nature with love and compassion.

This includes myself.

Directing my awareness with love and compassion will allow me to identify opportunities for improving the quality of my consciousness. All living things share in consciousness and have their own awareness. It is my responsibility and mission to recognize the fundamental needs of other conscious beings and to find ways to aid them in their efforts to grow and improve.

#### Evaluating Your Motives

Consciousness is everything.

Consciousness localized is awareness. All differentiated things are aware. Consciousness wants to get better. It gets better through self-awareness and awareness of others, and by setting intentions that may impact the self and others.

Attention, intention, and action are easier in an environment of love and compassion than one of fear and competition.

To consciousness achieve its objective, I must approach all aware or conscious beings with love and compassion to maximize their ability to get better.

#### Considering the Broad Personal and Social Impact of Goals

As I go through life, I have attention and intent as my main abilities. Applying or directing my attention with love will feel good. Approaching living things and nature with love and compassion will position me to have a positive impact however I can.

I want anyone else to attend and approach me with love and compassion, so this is my strategy as well. Hopefully others will see and respect my intent enough to follow suit and join me in this effort to grow the quality of our consciousness. If they do, many of our difficulties and much of our suffering will cease and fade.

#### Considering the Detailed Strategies for Goal Attainment

Making progress toward this goal happens one moment at a time. I have many opportunities to reinforce and progress toward this goal throughout any given day. I must simply recognize living things and nature, understand how my actions and decisions impact them, and then act or decide to act in ways that are driven by love and compassion.

Compassion requires me to understand others' needs and to fully feel and empathize with their suffering in lack of those needs. I will have to meditate on and contemplate their condition to help mold compassion into my intent.

#### Identifying Potential Obstacles and their Solutions

I may fail to achieve this goal if:

- I do not recognize something as living.
- I do not recognize something as nature.
- I do not attend, intend, act with love.
- I do not hold compassion for something.
- I am faced with a choice that may yield help one thing but hurt another.

The last scenario is the most difficult to avoid. I can act out of love and compassion and still hurt something, as long as the alternatives would hurt more or lead to more suffering.

Otherwise, I must be careful not to hold any illusions about what is living or natural. Human-made devices are generally not living or natural, but they could be. I must always ask whether love is motivating my action. I must continually generate compassion by seeking a personal understanding of the suffering of others.

This shouldn't be too hard to achieve, but laziness or deception may stand in the way.

#### Monitoring Progress towards Desired Goals

Reflection will reveal whether I am progressing toward or succeeding in this goal. I can ask two simple questions:

- How have I interacted with someone or something without love or compassion?
- How have I failed to have compassion for something or someone?

### Prioritize personal growth and responsibility.

When setting my intentions I cut through the trappings and delusions of my ego. I shed needs, wants, desires, expectations, and avoid promises. Having dissolved my ego, I evaluate the quality of my consciousness, of my being, without judgment or fear. I intend to grow and improve, trusting that others are more well suited to grow and improve themselves, and that my own development may inspire them to do the same.

I cannot direct others' attention, set their intentions, or make their choices. I can attract their attention, question their intentions, and inform their choices.

#### Evaluating Your Motives

In figuring out what to do, I must first ask what I can do. I can make my own choices and take my own actions. I cannot make others' choices or take their actions.

So even if my larger goal is to improve the quality of consciousness as a whole, my personal goals must start with me and seek to improve my own consciousness first.

This is why I am here, why I have been given free will, why I have choices: to personally grow.

Personal responsibility is as important as personal growth because unless I am self-sufficient, others will have to support me, which will detract from their ability to personally grow. While I cannot expect to be entirely independent, and I do not expect to care only for myself, we can each strive to be personally responsible in order to optimize our efforts in personal growth by ensuring that our feedback loops are tight, i.e., we see our quality, make our choices, and see the impact directly, rather than having to project our evaluations, decisions, or result measurement through the minds or to the situations of others.

#### Considering the Broad Personal and Social Impact of Goals

At first it may seem that I am acting selfishly. This is true to an extent.

If I succeed in prioritizing personal growth, I will be more whole, more healthy, more happy, more stable, more directed. Others may observe these improvements. Prioritizing personal growth does not mean that I will not strive to improve the lives of others.

A big factor in personal growth is giving love, learning to love, and living in love. Love has a target, whether that is the self or others. So part of my personal growth will be manifested as loving intent and action for the benefit of others.

Taking responsibility for myself will also benefit others who would otherwise take responsibility for me. They will have more time and energy to devote to their own growth and personal responsibility. It can be easy to place the secondary needs of others before our own primary needs. This is not a sustainable strategy. The most effective strategy is to each improve ourselves, and to make sure that helping others out of love and compassion is part of improving ourselves.

#### Considering the Detailed Strategies for Goal Attainment

When making plans, I must examine my motivations and priorities. If I am ignoring my own primary needs in order to focus on the primary or secondary needs of others, I am not succeeding at this goal.
Prioritizing will most often occur when I am setting, examining, adjusting my intentions before bed or throughout the day. I will have many small opportunities to progress toward this goal, and those small opportunities can yield great progress if I am mindful of my motivations.

#### Identifying Potential Obstacles and their Solutions

People ask for help and need help, and I want to give them help. I must be mindful of whether helping them will prevent me from pursuing personal growth or taking responsibility for myself. I must be careful not to overcommit myself to service of others to my own detriment. I cannot continue to serve others if I do not also care for myself.

#### Monitoring Progress towards Desired Goals

Prioritizing personal growth and responsibility ought to propel progress in these areas. If, after a significant number of choices, I notice that I am not growing or more responsible for myself, then I am not progressing toward this goal. Conversely if I am focusing on personal growth and responsibility but becoming too isolated to help anyone else, it is likely that I could be making more progress toward this goal by helping others more.

Concrete metrics for personal growth and responsibility are difficult to define, but I can ask a few simple questions to help evaluate my progress:

- Do I depend more on other people than I used to?
- Am I more capable of love and compassion than I used to be?
- Do others feel like they have to take care of me more than before?

### Set, examine, and adjust your intentions regularly.

At least daily, before I sleep, I review, examine, adjust, and set my intentions.

When I awaken, I recall my intentions and decide which to prioritize in the coming minutes, hours, days.

I do not let my intentions gather dust, nor do I assume that they remain prudent or valid as my choices influence my being.

Regular meditation and contemplation allows me to manage my intentions efficiently.

#### Evaluating Your Motives

Intent is the second fundamental ability (other than attention) that I have as a conscious being. Intent is exercised as time travel into a possible future. I set intentions by imagining a possible, desirable future.

Because this is one of only two fundamental abilities I have, I must exercise it. Failure to do so is like a bird keeping its wings tucked and walking instead. I must fly.

For much of my life I have failed to set intentions, or have lost faith in myself to set and follow intentions, or have lost sight of intentions that I have set.

Pursuing this goal will be a joy and a pleasure, but it will also require me to avoid distractions and shed delusions. This is perhaps the most important goal a person can have.

#### Considering the Broad Personal and Social Impact of Goals

Attaining this goal will result in a life well-examined and well-lived. I will have taken responsibility for the quality of my being and lived a full and mindful life. Every choice I make will have reasons. Everyone who wants to know why I do what I do or say what I say will be able to find out just by asking me. There will be no mysteries. I will have no regrets.

Ideally, others will fully exercise their intent as well and live full lives with me.

#### Considering the Detailed Strategies for Goal Attainment

Exercising my intent can become a daily practice, much like yoga or meditation. I can set periodic times or identify key moments to evaluate and set my intentions. I must take a small amount of mindful, quiet time every day to attain this goal. I must have the courage to take this time for myself so that I may serve others more mindfully.

#### Identifying Potential Obstacles and their Solutions

It is easy to lose sight of my intentions, to forget them, or to forget to set or update them as I go along. Needs, wants, expectations, desires, delusions of the ego can obscure my intentions or distract me from them. Life gets in the way, as they say. I will need to maintain rhythm when setting intentions, acting on them, and attending their results. This feedback loop needs to complete so that I can begin a new one and continue progressing toward higher quality of consciousness.

#### Monitoring Progress towards Desired Goals

The practice of setting, examining, and adjusting my intentions has a built-in progress monitor. In achieving this goal, I will know if I am achieving it.

I will ask:

- When have I failed to set sufficient intentions to support or inform my choices?
- When have I failed to reexamine or adjust my intentions following actions that exercised them? - When have I been distracted from my intent by delusions of my ego?

### Seize opportunities to take action and grow quality.

Once my attention has succeeded in bringing opportunities to light, I do not wait or delay. I apply my intent and wisdom, and approach the opportunities with courage and compassion.

When opportunities do not present themselves, I seek them out, but not in spite of my health or balance.

#### Evaluating Your Motives

Once I have got my attention set on love and compassion for nature and all its beings, and my intent recurrently set and evaluated with my personal growth as the top priority, it's time to take action. Sitting around with good intentions and all the love in the universe isn't going to get me any closer to higher quality consciousness. And I can't just force my intentions into any old scenario. I need to channel my loving attention and good intentions into situations where manifesting them will benefit my quality and ease the suffering of others. This is certainly important, because without this goal, all the rest are futile.

#### Considering the Broad Personal and Social Impact of Goals

With so many conscious beings milling about with free will and the agency to act, it can be hard to know who should step up and take action. If I do not, someone or something else will. I do not and cannot know their intentions or predict whether their actions will serve the quality of our consciousness. So when I see an opportunity to exercise my well-set, well-informed compassionate intent, I need to seize it. Resting on my laurels (in the aggregate) will almost assuredly provide less improvement to the quality of my consciousness than acting.

#### Considering the Detailed Strategies for Goal Attainment

Opportunities can present themselves if we have the right ambient queries running in our environment, or we can seek out suitable opportunities to exercise our intent. So that leaves me with two tactical approaches to attaining this goal: browse or search. I can amble around the world like the flaneur/entrepreneur (entreflaneur?) I fancy myself, ready to pounce when opportunities for growth arise. Or I can be on the prowl, Googling for the set of circumstances that will suit my offerings. I'll surely do some of each. The latter tactic requires me to set an intention to search. The former requires me to pay more attention to what transpires immediately in my vicinity.

#### Identifying Potential Obstacles and their Solutions

With so many variables swimming around, I might be thwarted in countless ways. Others can seize opportunities away from me. I can fail to recognize them. I can fail to have intentions prepared to confront the opportunities I encounter. I can fail to encounter suitable opportunities at all by being in the wrong place or time.

I will not be able to evaluate in hindsight whether I followed the optimal path. However I can ask, for each individual opportunity, how I could have recognized it more readily or seized it more resolutely. I must review my performance as I evaluate my quality of being.

#### Monitoring Progress towards Desired Goals

My emotional state is relatively attuned to measuring my success in this goal. I will experience joy and sadness as I succeed in seizing and fail to seize supple opportunities for personal growth. I will be mindful of my emotional state to collect clues. Then I will assess my performance during my intention setting practice.

### Choose wisely to manifest your intentions.

With intentions well set and opportunities identified and seized, I make choices. I take the results of past decisions into account without judgment or fear. I have examined and designed the future I wish to inhabit as I set my intentions. Upon these pillars of prudence, I trust myself to choose and act.

#### Evaluating Your Motives

Attention paid, personal growth prioritized, intentions set, opportunity seized, now I have a choice to make. I must channel all of those preparations into prudent, sensible action to manifest my intentions. This is important too because it is another serial link in the chain of quality improvement.

This might be the easiest goal to reach because so many of the others feed into it, but it is also the most important because it brings all the rest of my efforts to fruition.

#### Considering the Broad Personal and Social Impact of Goals

It seems pithy, perhaps simple, to say that my goal is to make good choices. Certainly this would have broader beneficial social impact, and direct impact on me personally. If making good choices doesn't help me or anyone, they are not good choices.

As a key link in the chain, this goal allows me and anyone else to evaluate the success of the prior links. Others cannot know my intentions or count the opportunities I missed, but they can look at the results of my choices. This goal makes my quality of being evaluable by others. I will want to be careful that I don't substitute their evaluations of my quality for my own judgment.

#### Considering the Detailed Strategies for Goal Attainment

Wise choices are informed by good intentions and brave, non-judgmental insight into past choices. I'll need to continue supplying myself with these to succeed.

I'll try to choose wisely in small ways and in big ways. Every moment offers me a choice. I must be judicious about when to choose and when to relax. Choices I cannot choose to avoid are the most obvious opportunities to progress toward this goal. Choices I need not make can be the big ones. I can seek them out.

#### Identifying Potential Obstacles and their Solutions

Wisdom is not a given. We are born without it and we must develop it personally. We cannot borrow wisdom, or adopt it. It grows in the dank, fertile soil of our failures and successes that collects around our soul.

I can fail to attain this goal if:

- I forget my intentions or neglect them
- I let delusions of my ego cloud my judgment, fooling me into seeking pleasure or satisfying expectations - I fail to choose any course of action once I have identified an opportunity

#### Monitoring Progress towards Desired Goals

As my attention (rooted in love and compassion) returns to the situation in which I chose to act, I will be able to evaluate the wisdom of my choice and the goodness of the intent that propelled it. In completing the feedback loop, I will gather data to inform the next loop.

Monitoring my choices has been a common practice throughout my life. It takes the form of reflection, contemplation, rumination, or emotionally it can manifest as guilt, shame, regret, bliss, relief, contentment.

Mindfulness will keep me aware of my progress on this goal.

### Compose and produce meaning from energy, wisdom, and intent.

No work is valuable that does not produce meaning. I do not work. Work is effort applied without enjoyment or fulfillment. Nor do I spend my time on efforts that do not produce meaning.

Instead, I spend my energy wisely and intentionally, composing my Truth into meaning that I can share and give to others in exchange for what I need to continue growing.

#### Evaluating Your Motives

After a decade spent seeking progress through technology, I see now how futile my efforts were. Technology provided an engrossing distraction from our lack of real progress toward a higher quality of consciousness. That pursuit, based in a collective ego delusion of the science-minded but godless, has yielded little satisfaction or inner peace.

Meaning is something anyone can identify, but few can predict what others will identify as meaningful. Meaning is personal, granted its weight by the observer, by the conscious being paying attention to a situation. By aspiring to compose and produce meaning, I have tasked myself with something difficult and evasive. This will be tricky, but easy to enjoy.

#### Considering the Broad Personal and Social Impact of Goals

If I succeed at this goal, you will know. My efforts will be meaningful to you. I will have applied my love and compassion, noticed something important to you, intended to improve that situation, seized an opportunity to do so, and made a wise choice to manifest my intent in a way you will be able to observe or recognize.

Of all the possible uses for my energy, wisdom, and intent, I can think of none more worthy.

#### Considering the Detailed Strategies for Goal Attainment

Succeeding at this will take practice. I will fail a lot. I will have to keep trying.

I will not know in advance if I have composed meaning that others will value or recognize. I will have to share what I have crafted to find out. This will take courage and devotion.

So I will write, and I will sing and dance, I will draw and paint, and smile and laugh, and argue and agree. I will build and test and break and iterate. I will dream big and live lean. And I will not give up, unless my ego has led me astray.

#### Identifying Potential Obstacles and their Solutions

The proof is in the pudding when it comes to composing or producing meaning. Anything that stops me from making the pudding can stand in the way of this goal.

I stand to fail at this if:

- I let some who don't catch the meaning deter me from offering it to those who will.
- I get stuck portraying the meaning in a way that others don't understand.
- I attempt to compose meaning without wisdom, energy, or intent, or with only one or none of these.

#### Monitoring Progress towards Desired Goals

I will know that I have succeeded when others can recount the meaning back to me in their own words (or even more surprisingly in my words that they have internalized and adopted). Then I will know they understand.

In order to monitor my success, I will need to accept feedback in its many forms. Non-response is feedback. Criticism, however harsh, is feedback. Failure to grok it at all is feedback. If I aspire to be understood, I cannot accept anything less as success. But I also must not be discouraged by failure. Failure can fuel my efforts more powerfully than success.

### Give pause to yourself and others. Rest and revel.

I maintain balance between action and rest. Recovery and rest are integral to clarity and health. I can love more wholly and fuel my compassion by being patient and kind to myself in the face of my ambitions for growth. I am brave enough to stop when I am tired.

#### Evaluating Your Motives

We rush and hurry. For what? What progress are we aiming for? What is the goal? Is it riches? Or peace? Are we hungry? Are we sad? Are we lonely?

Many of us have different unmet primary needs. Rushing doesn't serve many, if any, of them. This goal is important and valid in light of the needless hurry in which I am unwillingly mired.

#### Considering the Broad Personal and Social Impact of Goals

Giving pause will have tangible and spiritual rewards.

Stress is easy to feel. I can glance at my emotional state to tell whether I am feeling rushed. Anyone can do this. I can ask them to. If I can give enough pause, the stress around me will be noticeably less.
Sighs of relief, titters of joy, whoops of revelry, and the peace of repose will all be signs I am succeeding in this aspiration.

#### Considering the Detailed Strategies for Goal Attainment

At any moment I can ask whether I feel rushed, or whether I notice others rushing. Then I can look for an opportunity to manifest this intention to give pause in my situation or theirs.

Whether I am interacting casually with friends or family, collaborating intently with a team, standing in an elevator with strangers, stuck in traffic on the freeway, or standing in line at a restaurant, I can look for hurry and give pause.

Rest and revelry have a place in almost every moment.

#### Identifying Potential Obstacles and their Solutions

The world abounds with obstacles to this goal. Most beings in mortal bodies feel a morbid sense of urgency from their first exposure to death until their own death. They allow this fear of death to bleed into almost every choice they make. Few of us find solace from this fear, and most of the solace we find stems from belief or delusion, religion or spiritual myopia.

I will fail in this goal if:

- I hurry.
- I do not rest and revel myself as I attempt to give others pause.
- I keep the pause rather than giving it away.
- I shrink from the challenge of disillusioning my companions on this mortal coil.
- I revel without resting, or rest without reveling, or compel others to get only half of it.

#### Monitoring Progress towards Desired Goals

Stress is a great test. Do I feel rushed? Do I have deadlines? Does anyone? Am I pressured to achieve? Does anyone know why we are rushing?

I will know if this is working when we answer "no" to all but the last question. Giving pause and living without hurry will be self-evident. Coincidentally, there is no hurry to give pause either. I must simply remain vigilant and attentive and respond as the hurry encroaches on our revelry.

### Consume only for health, growth, and joy.

I continually monitor and explore the operation of my body in order to learn what it needs. I eat foods and drugs that give it energy, nourishment, and the building blocks it needs to grow strong, to heal, and to stay flexible and agile.

The other goods I consume I also select for health, energy, and joy. My clothes are comfortable and beautiful. My tools are simple and effective. My toys are few and fun. My furniture is minimal. My vehicles are fast, safe and efficient. Maintaining my wardrobe, toys, tools, and other possessions does not take time away from more worthy pursuits.

I do not buy, acquire, collect, or gather objects in an attempt to fill the emptiness inside left by lack of quality of being. I take a deep breath, examine my want or desire, find its root and endeavor to fulfill that directly instead.

I do not waste anything, but I do not let the desire not to waste consume time spent more fruitfully on growth, love, and compassion.

#### Evaluating Your Motives

My ego crafts all kinds of delusions to keep me safe from my fears. Now that I do not fear death or failure, I have little need for my ego or its delusions, or for my intellect and its seemingly well-reasoned justifications for the pursuits of my ego.

My ego loves to want things, it concocts secondary needs, it tells me to fulfill my desires. These wants, secondary needs, and desires leave me yearning for stuff, things, experiences, feelings, and often I consume to satisfy them.

Breaking free from these habits of needless consumption will help me to liberate from my ego, and to ensure that it stays dissolved.

#### Considering the Broad Personal and Social Impact of Goals

Much of our hurry is driven by the pursuit of happiness where happiness is a satisfied ego that distracts us from the suffering our unaddressed fears may bring. We want more because the last stuff we got didn't work (yet). I am done with that downward spiral.

If we can all focus our consumptive impulse on what we need for health and growth and joy, we will not feel the need to hurry or produce or work nearly as hard or nearly as much. We will be able to rest and revel, and find true happiness in growing the quality of our conscious being, rather than being bogged down and distracted by the things that soothe our egos.

#### Considering the Detailed Strategies for Goal Attainment

Stewardship of this lovely human body requires a certain amount of consumption. The breatharians might prescribe a more ascetic program than the one I end up following, but I certainly don't need to consume much of what I used to. Health is relatively simple to achieve if I continually inform my decisions with new insight and do not allow myself to confuse the issue by poisoning myself with consumption that soothes my ego and harms my health.

Consumption for growth is only that which is necessary to keep my body working so that I can pursue more important goals. Consumption for joy is serendipitous, not wasteful, and serves no deluded want or need originating from my ego.

#### Identifying Potential Obstacles and their Solutions

It is easy to catch the fleas by lying with the dogs. I have fallen into countless bad habits of consumption by mimicking or abiding the behavior of friends, family, and society at large. Many of the things I have consumed did not bring me health, growth, or joy.

I stand to fail at this goal if:

- I do not question what I consume.
- I do not seek joy, growth, or health.
- I do not identify what will offer me health.
- I allow my ego to taint my sense of growth, joy, or health.

#### Monitoring Progress towards Desired Goals

To evaluate my success in this endeavor, I will want to check in periodically with my consumption habits. I can ask, as I consume something, a few insightful questions:

- What need does this serve?
- Does this bring me joy? How?
- Is this healthy? How?
- Does this free me to pursue personal growth? How?
- Why do I want this?
