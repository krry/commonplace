# Areas

- [[get-real]]
- [[full-smile]]
- [[atmanaut]]
- [[sovereignty]]
- [[poetry]]
- [Stories](/areas/stories), like:
  - [Ä€tman](/areas/stories/atman)
  - [Playing Title](/areas/stories/playing-title)
  - [[clotho-rewoven]]
  - [[sissy-no-fuss-ep-1]]

Here we keep notes about my areas of responsibility and pointed interest, especially those that don't fit within one of the [projects](/projects) at the moment. The second tier of [[para]], these are important but not time-sensitive pursuits.
