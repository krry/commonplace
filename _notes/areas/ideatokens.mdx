# Ideatokens

When we come up with something that could be of value to someone else, wouldn't it be nice if we could share it openly with them imprinted on an [[NFT]], then if the idea came to fruition and was valuable to the marketplace or the world at large those who profit from the idea could express their gratitude by paying royalties to the NFT holder?

Given how the marketplace works today how often do we refrain from sharing ideas that could benefit others and instead keep them in the hopes that we might recoup the value of their potential on the long shot that we could enter the market and somehow catch up and then surpass those who are already running at full speed in that space?

If we allow the value of the NFT to balance itself in the marketplace by widespread use and adoption, that is to say, if everyone is sharing ideas on NFTs then everyone also wants to honor the value of those non-fungible ideas.

This note with a timestamp and a git commit hash and a URL can perhaps serve as the necessary kernel of a non-fungible idea. we may also require those who read a non-fungible idea to record their identity and time of viewing, read receipts essentially.
