# Reading Be As You Are by Sri Ramana Maharshi

## Notes from the inner back cover

Swimming in turiyatita\
Ever waking dreaming sleeping\
Jnani knows only nothing\
molts the mind\
sheds the sheaths\
we mistake for our self

Witness samskara and let it be not\
Ensnare a visana then release the catch\

Hridayam Mouna: this is the Center\
the Heart teeming with Silence.

Jnani coasts, a karma glider\
the vicar of vichara:\
no I-thought, no more grief.\
Thru our eyes, three persons can arise:\
me, you, them\
ignorant, suffering, separate "I"s.

One can japa along: "_Aham_, I am,\
Iswara, I, I. Who am I\
but a one-way mantra train to Samadhi\
full of shakti,\
fueled by bhakti marga,\
running on empty\
and the love thereof.
