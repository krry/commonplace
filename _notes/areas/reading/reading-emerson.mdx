# Reading Emerson, Ralph Waldo

[Self-Reliance](https://archive.vcu.edu/english/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/essays/selfreliance.html), c. 1847

> In the [sub-par] attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.

Work need not be toil. In fact, properly executed work is effortlessâ€”spun on by the dynamo of flow, out of time, nevermind. All the same no muse befriends. She alights upon the fearless spirit, free of mind and the net of fears it weaves around a being. She preens her butterfly wings and deigns a soul a suitable stoop that quivers not with anticipation and expectation, that swells and ebbs with hearty throbs, that bristles with furry purchase at the curious graze of a passing playmate.

> Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play with it.

Infancy, from the French _I'enfant_, means "not speaking". Do we qualify as infants those with foreign or flaccid tongues? Infants be the trees? Cast we natives too as infants?

A minute eye-to-eye of silent gazing will clarify the poignant power of the infant to a bell tone. Ten minutes will hone it to a crystal note. In an hour you can see, know, be everything and everyone. Such attention may stigmatize you, such focus may pin you up: becoming the infant's subject can be excruciating, and yet exhilarating.

> A boy is in the parlour what the pit is in the playhouse

To snip the crippling, trembling tethers of adulthood (forgetting decades of learned fears), and yet to retain the parlance (the translation layer), and the reach and strength and the choreography of maturity (the skills of expression), would poise a mortal as divine.

> The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion.

If a man loves bread, a man makes bread. And eats it, for waste spoils any venture.

> Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.

Your mind is sacred, and seems private. All else is sacred. No more is private.

> the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it.

What I constitute, stand with, ought to be a sure, trim set of truths.

NO WORDS MATTER

Obviously. But also, coincidentally, the first words of our scriptures seem to contradict this clarity.
