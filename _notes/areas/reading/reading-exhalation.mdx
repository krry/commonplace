# Reading Exhalation

A group of stories by Ted Chiang

## The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate

A Gate of Seconds, one side a few seconds behind the other.

A Gate of Years, an obsidian ring suspending a rift in time, 20 years prior or 20 years hence, depending on which side one enters.

## Exhalation

An argonaut among its people, who breathes two pressurized mech-lungs of argon each day, replacing them when empty, microscopically examines its own mechanical brain while fully awake and aware, discovering that life breathes, the breath ticks the clock of consciousness, and rather than consuming argon/air (which is inert and nonreactive), they are lowering the pressure of the finite, bottled atmosphere.

"But in truth the source of life is _a difference in air pressure_, the flow of air from spaces where it is thick to those where it is thin."

Let's entertain the analogy to zero point energy and quantum wave function collapse as the source of consciousness in our universe.

## What's Expected of Us

Determinism described by a helpless pawn.

## The Lifecycle of Software Objects

## The one about the Robo-nanny
