# Karl Popper's Philosophy

## On Science

No scientific theory is provable by experiment or logic, only falsifiable by these. A theory has many consequences. Proof that one consequence is correct cannot prove the other consequences correct.

wrote his seminal work, *Logic of Scientific Discovery* in 1934

Experiments must be designed to disprove a theory! Only those experiments which can refute a theory can support the theory. Science proceeds via speculation, which the positivists decry.

## On Politics

The basic idea of democracy is to limit power, to control it by distributing it.

Only when we establish a concept of absolute truth can we see how modest/humble we must be, because we simply don't have any criterion of truth, we don't have the truth in our pocket.
