# Reading Ohsawa

## Zen Macrobiotics

ยง3.1 No Fatigue

> You should not feel fatigued. If you catch cold, your organism has been tired for many years. Even one cold in ten years is a bad sign for there is no bird or insect that ever catches cold, even in cold counties and cold weather. The root of your disease is therefore very deep. If you are prone to saying, "It is too difficult", "It is impossible", or "I am not prepared for such a thing", you reveal the extent of your problem.
>
> If you are really healthy, you can overpower and chase away difficulties one after the other as a dog chases a rabbit. If you avoid ever larger difficulties, however, you are a defeatist.
>
> We must be adventurers in life since today unceasingly advances into tomorrow, the unknown. The bigger the difficulty, the bigger the pleasure. This attitude is the sign of freedom from fatigue.
>
> Fatigue is the real foundation of all diseases. You can cure it without any medicine if you understand and practice the Macrobiotic way to longevity and rejuvenation.

Posted an excerpt to NAAS about the correlation between fatigue and cold. Seems apropos to today's pandemic crisis.
