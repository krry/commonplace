# Just a grin

It's hard to know what is really helping these days, but a smile is a sure sign along the right path. Let's start there.

# The Full Smile Story

## What Needs Attention

People often talk of enough. Will we have enough fresh water? Do we have enough food? Are there enough fish in the sea? Are there enough rainforests left for our Mother Earth to keep breathing?

Well, we've had enough... all along.

The problem we face as Full Smile is Scarcity. You've heard that story a thousand times today: in the idle rush of your commute, in the unarticulated pressure of your work jargon, in the need to pee you're... It's been over-told for millennia and, frankly, we're all sick of it. **If you're sick, you're sick because of it.** Let's zoom out.

Sitting as we are on this blue marble sailing through the endless cosmos, we often wonder if we are okay. It's a wordless question all life understands. "OK?" This query is the kernel of compassion. The Story of Scarcity doesn't answer this question, but it worries (us) about it.

At the root, behind the veil, of any fear, concern, or issue we confront today is Scarcity and our belief in it. Full Smile's aim is to flip that bit.

## Willing Improvement

Scarcity, like its elysian rival Abundance, is a matter of belief. And belief, that old gremlin we seldom forget, is a matter of choice. The core of what Full Smile offers is an old choice made again, this time less poopily.

Full Smile brings the heat to your cheeks in the middle of the week when the skies are open wide and your insides just want to be outside playing in the park. We start small, in no hurry, with a smile here and there, caring eyes beside you, patience listening, healers offering a hand to each other. Why? Because we've had enough‚Ä¶ all along.

Our organization includes you, anyone, all of yall. The way it works is we remember how to play together. Full Smile can beam right into your home, or show up on your commute. We might be just around the corner, blowing bubbles at the end of the rainbow, ready to listen, hug, heal, play, and enjoy ourself.

Our smiles are messengers of metta, karuna, mudita, uppekha: loving kindness, compassion, shared joy, and equanimity.

They come in all the sizes, shapes, flavors, varieties you comprise.

## Our Novelty

Few confront Scarcity face first. Instead we tend to address the problems our belief in Scarcity brings, problems that fall into the categories of issues we all hope to tackle like climate change, healthcare, and poverty.

üåπ Full Smile nips these issues in the bud, boops them right on the stuffy nose.

The tidal wave of positive transformation we embody begins within each of us as a gentle sigh of surrender to the love we comprise.

We cannot hope to cure what ails us by focusing our attention only outward, on the problems in the environment where our flailing efforts to control nature continually fail, or on the actions and attitudes of others. But by peering within through the slice of Eden that drives us to enjoy the beauty of life, we can learn to water our roots, and to see what grows as opportunities for play, rather than as threats to be met with power exertion, rights enforcement, or supremetrical authoritatevaluatory adjudicationalysis.

We will help even the smallest smiles to rise, and the driest of eyes to cry. No smile left upside down!

## Our Intention

More smiles, more joy, less suffering.

Full Smile offers increased holistic well-being as directly as possible, delivered straight to your face, body, mind, spirit, feet, belly, ears, dogs, cats, and neighbors. Our smiles are just the messengers.

The message might be food if you're hungry. A smile aimed just right completes the link, and there you go: Full Belly Smile. We often forget how easy it can be when we let ourselves enjoy it here.

The message might be warmth if you're chilly. Try a smile broadly applied to the area nearby with a shivery glint in your eye. A blanket or a hug or a hot cider mug will be surer to find you.

We don't know which smile will do it, but it won't be a scowl or a sneer or a sly little smirk. We devote ourself fully to smiles, since these are the surest signs we are helping spirits rise.

## Defining Success

This might come as a surprise, but our impact metrics are smiles ;)

Full Smiles are hard to miss, and with the recent advancements in point cloud emotio-facial recognition etherware scanners, it'll be a cinch to map our progress through this gentle revolution of loving kindness and connectedness.

Wherever we go, we'll bring smiles to share. They tend to spread on their own, but just in case, we'll craft them in many, many forms. Anyone can join us. We'll have them each keep a tally :D

## Origin Story

I had just awakened. As I stretched my fingertips as high as they would go and my toes as low, a wave of wonderment washed over every wiggle of my being. I turned my head to my partner and said, "Full Body Smile!" which led us immediately to wonder what else could smile that wasn't yet.

As we puzzled and pondered, it became perfectly palpable that we were onto something groundbreaking. A riddle arose: what doesn't a smile help? Even a partial smile adds a pinch of nice to a spoonful of gloom.

## Driving Passion

This is it. The reason we're here. To breathe in possibilities, choose the best option, and exhale the rest through a smile of humble gratitude (or nostrils). And while it took us this long to realize what we came to do, now there is nothing else worth doing. So we fill up our smiles and tumble into the day wondering what else can smile that isn't yet.

We've suffered from Scarcity our whole lives. Almost everyone has. Even the Dalai Lama will tell you that life is suffering. We're all sick of it. And we've had enough all along, so we think it's time to act like it.

The beauty of Full Smile is in its grace, its breadth, its ease, and its shine. We can't think of anything that could brighten more lives. Sharing the joie de vivre as openly and directly as possible keeps our eyes on the prize. The prize is that joy, and there is nothing else to win no matter what the story of Scarcity that keeps us mired in misery tells us.

Full Smile is what we are here to do.

## Our Founders

While we only just met this year, we've been headed toward Full Smile our whole lives. We were partners within minutes of meeting in Black Rock City, and it took about a day for Full Smile to congeal as the concept we would manifest together. Each day as we collude (from the Latin 'colludere' meaning "to play together", which has become strangely villanized in our nomenclature) and relate our dreams, our vision and our roles in bringing it about become clearer. Our partnership is an effortless leap forward along each of our paths as they dovetail.

It takes two cheeks to make a full smile. We are those cheeks.

Each of us has a wide range of depths of skill, interest, and ability that complement and synergize the other. Both designers of experience and product and healers of mind and body, Elysa is an artist in many media, and Kerry is a smith of words and algorithms. We share an imagination‚Äîwe co-ideate, riff, and draft‚Äîand then set our practiced hands to compose and conduct the movement.

### Ability to Grow

We've each played pivotal roles in a series of rapidly growing organizations who have endeavored to lift our collective spirits.

‚Ä¢ At Togetherville we gave kids and their families a safe, fun place to authentically connect with the world on the Internet.
‚Ä¢ At SolarCity we reminded millions that we don't have to burn the earth to fuel our lives, that the sun has enough energy for all of us.
‚Ä¢ At Arrivo we rethought transportation technology and infrastructure from the ground up and designed a hyper-safe, hyper-fast system where we don't travel, we just arrive.
‚Ä¢ At IDEO, we developed the Design Thinking for Educators Platform reached 100,000+ downloads in 7 languages.
‚Ä¢ At Google, Elysa designs and leads the Culture of Creativity Platform at Google for over 3800 employees globally.
‚Ä¢ At Stanford's d.school, we teach ‚ÄúFrom Play to Innovation,‚Äù using the science of play to spark creativity and innovation.

### Entreprenurial Spirit

When I was nine, my dad told me to get a job. I asked him what kind of a job. He said something nearby, around the neighborhood. "Maybe you could paint the neighbors' house numbers on their curbs so people can find their houses." So I put some spray paint and some stencils in my red wagon and hit the sidewalk. At five bucks a house, I did fine for age nine.

Elysa, who invented the Full Smile, is a masterful leader and teacher of creativity, design, and artful expression in oodles of spaces, vectors, and media. Her latest installation *One Last Thing* at the Laundry during Reimagine End of Life 2019 offers a space for you to send and receive messages to those you've lost. She can wear her heart outside her body.

### Overcoming Adversity

At Togetherville we struggled to find funding in 2010. So we spent the next year in a dingy basement office working 100 hours a week to build an online community where kids and their families could authentically connect. And we persevered until Disney acquired us :)

Or, I once climbed Hua Shan Mountain in central China. We started at the base in our t-shirts on a hot summer night and reached the frosty top two hours before dawn where we huddled together for warmth and purred until the most magnificent sunrise I have ever seen. Then the cable car took us down. No one had told me there was a cable car.

At Google, Elysa was at first a lone provocateur, a design innovator salmon swimming upstream against the safe current of the status quo. She was able to magnetize key collaborators from around the organization to resource a $500,000 company-wide effort in empathic creativity and experience design including Camp Create, a 60-day global experiment in creative development.

### Leadership Potential

Me? I'm a bit of a fool. I wander, tumble, trip and fall into the downy dawn. Those who follow me find themselves surprised by the whimsy that lies just ahead but often hides. I lead those who fear to try to know the fire in their hearts. I once led a team of dozens at SolarCity to build a way for homeowners to assess the viability of going solar from their iPad.

At IDEO, Elysa led the design and content for the Design Thinking for Educators Toolkit, which has reached over 100,000 educators and has been translated into 7 languages. She then created the first Design Thinking MOOC in collaboration with Edutopia (the George Lucas Foundation for Education) in under 4 weeks which had over 30,000 teachers participate. This initiative served as a proof of concept that enabled funding and dedicated resources toward the longer term vision of The Teachers‚Äô Guild, a collaborative online design platform that now holds more than 40 workshops a year in 4 school districts.

## What we hope to gain from and contribute to the fellowship community

In a word, abundance. It is our fervent and certain hope that we can evolve the story of scarcity many of us tell each other into an experience of the abundance we already share and can more fully enjoy as our needs are met and fears are faced.

We need financial support in the short term as we embark on this mission. And the experiences of positive transformation we offer need communities of participants willing to transform and elevate themselves and each other.

Helping to power those in service of positive change fuels our own creative energy. It would be our honor to help the fellows in creative problem solving, deep user understanding, and fresh approaches in achieving their goals. When one of us thrives, we all thrive, and I am most passionate about moving us all forward in pursuit of bettering our communities and environments.
