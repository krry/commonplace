# Dr. Healhurt's Wheel

As we strive toward [[full-smile]], we will notice obstacles.

We are on the wheel of fortune, hurting and healing. If you want to enter yonder fuzzy glowing softly throbbing passageway, we ask that you surrender something dear to you that hurts quite a lot to hold. We accept this unfortunate bounty in four forms: fear, blame, guilt, and spite. To your dominant side you'll notice four slots of varying contour and welcomehood. Ignore them.
