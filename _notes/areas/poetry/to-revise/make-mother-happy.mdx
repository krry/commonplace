# Make mother happy

Perhaps happiness is a gift
a mother can receive
as well as she gives

We all know why she cries
The smoke fills fathers' skies
It is painful to bear us 
into a pit of VIPers and despair

but her love has already won
the moment you take breath one
and continues to with each next breath
