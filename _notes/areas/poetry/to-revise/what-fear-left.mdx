# Let's face it.

## As it turns out,

**the dark is inside**\
I close outside eyes\
gaze focusless back/in/down\
step to the shadow dance\
humanifest destiny\
cast in liquid obsidian

**the wild is my witness**\
as the pillars of the woods\
wave waiting exalting\
praying we will share God

**death is our doppelganger**\
'tis why we nightly sleep\
lest never the twain shall meet\
for to sever the tether\
what binds shadow to feet\
forsooth! 'tid seal yr defeat

**blood is de light**\
glowing thru my veins\
bathing every grain\
of my real estate\
in breath, holding\
love-making space

**speaking is public**
a butterfly's flutters by\
a hurricane can spool\
from Private Winks'\
careless whispers'\
secrets whirlpool

Heights showed me my destiny.
Public speaking is a power tool.
Death turned out to be my shadow.
Taxes are the principal uncertainty.
Snakes turned out to be snakes,
tarantulas are spiders are spiders
all of whom can be friends or enemies.
Sharks are big hungry smiley (friendable) fish.

# Fear Doesn't Remember

"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
~~nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror~~
~~which paralyzes needed efforts~~
~~to convert retreat into advance~~."
heartless, unfeeling, unqualified technology
which anesthetizes breathing essence
to convert harmony into progress.

Fear doesn't remember
the salty spray of a wave
the dusty kiss of a bee
the musky hug of a bear
the silky slip of a eel

the feathery flick of the fork at the tip of the tongue of the beast who once told Life herself to offer Man the chance to taste the fruit that holds the chance to choose what is
