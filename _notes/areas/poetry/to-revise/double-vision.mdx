# Double Vision

"Good looking out," says my inner voice.
You stop short and brace my heart.
Looking in I see green pastures, no fences
"FREE GRAZING" --- open all hours,
eyes, ears, minds, mouths, arms,
legs; widespread willingness
and ample abilities to avail
oneself of well set intentions
and paying attention.

She stops short and reaches out
hand-to-heart to brace for impact.
My beat quickens and a grin
glow worms onto my lips
She might do this for anyone
and I for nobody.
I don't need braces, not
sure what that is like,
but I too guard hearts
as we drive to the heights.
