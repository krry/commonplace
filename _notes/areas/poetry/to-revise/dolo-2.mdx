# Dolo 2

Come along with me
We've always been here
I don't know you from Eve
or the atoms
you believe to breathe.

A safety blanket
runway open
splash into bliss
or at least into us,
into this.

We're here
if you need to talk
and we're here
when you can sing.

Roll up
Let's jam
Jelly isn't chunky enough
