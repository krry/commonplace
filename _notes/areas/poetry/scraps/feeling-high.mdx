# Feeling high

A composer sees the music played by hundreds.
A composer plays the hundreds to the music. Some of them see.
A composer muses hundreds-deep, thousands even. The music has faded. The hundreds... well,
when does he stop feeling guilty about the hundreds?

"Tomorrow." Again? Broken wheel? This habit? Not fucking real. Write your mind you bag of farts. The punctuation really doesn't matter. They have minions for that. They also would like to liberate their mind-glands. They try to stop you when you make up words.

What does matter. Your feet matter. Those are really useful. Surprisingly stout.

Ideals may come out thick.
Always be diluting.
Most folks have a distasteful concentrate.

Your mind is the shit
I want to live inside it
Dems be stank ass fucks.
