# Poetry blotter

## Life is not suffering
That's half of it
A ball doesn't roll
by knowing its bottom

Uncoiled ex vagina
vandals gonna evandalize.
Get sold or else the rest
will drive you crazy.

## This is a call to inaction.
I backstroke past the breakers,
float in the moon's still glow,
prana in my water wings.
Akasha waves.
I wave back.

## Prickleblack
On this side it's plain to see
I cogitate and so I be
A glimpse of the kaleidoscape
void of sake
cleansed of sense
