# curbers

I've got the big breakthrough for ya
Ubers that just wait at the curb.
You get in and tell 'em where you want to be
and he knows the whole town
like there's a glowing map staring him in the face.

- "Hey ****Jarulo****, I got a big one, right here!"
  - I know what you thinkingâ€¦
  - Did Ja Rule go and make an island party butt baby with Jason Derulo?
