I've got a leaky svadishthana
this sacre de leche asana
blew my third leg open wide and I
need to root my bliss body now

the heat in me seeks the heat in you
inhale your full lotus may I?
exhale to shed athleisurewear
climb the bodhi tree and shake it

hands spread, heels down
hips to sky, drishti navel
dishing out kundalini and meatballs
finish with lululemon meringue pie
