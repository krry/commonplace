# An Ode to Partisans

Back across the Continental Divide
where the incontinent hide
to deride the confident few 
who rely on who lies inside
more defiant, more wily,
and snider than thou art
gods to the godless unwashed
masses of gassy fascist
anti-choice interlopers
groping for the ghost of hope
amidst the holy smokes
of old growth forest fires
and our damn cathedral spires

let's let yesterday burn
effigies to dogma perverse
thou art God as I am I and I
