# Explosacrum

I remember being 19
starring in a low-budget indie film
directed by my play nut
produced by my work nut

the plot was thinner than my boundaries
and weaker than my judgment

boy awakens fully erect
inserts himself into the day
scanning for a vessel
inviting and willing
somewhere soft to press
his throbbing head

*Spongeknob Spearpants*
the lawyers squirmed and writhed
twerked their billable bottom
lines on the working title

Casting has been ongoing since then
Shooting comes in sporadic spurts
Dead set, no takes for months
Then all night and day for a hot week Ã  Paris en juillet

While we aim to shoot on location
we'll occasionally paint the walls
of an off-season occidental motel
you'll want to avoid the bedspreads
anywhere between towns west of here
