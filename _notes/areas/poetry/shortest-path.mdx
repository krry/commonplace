# Shortest Path

Look at how unique we all are.
What a beautiful blizzard is blowing up.
So many snowflakes, each a touch different.
The glam is absurd when you know the Truth.
Oneness keeps dipping in and out, on and off our radar
It's a matter of waves of delusion.
Some waves crash harder, some hold more weight.

I have always felt different. A little odd.
They told me I was special. Gifted even.
Every breath is a gift from God, they said.
They capitalize the 'G' to set 'God' apart from 'god'.

A compact dog licks his every part at my one o'clock at whatever time it is. They didn't fix him. He wasn't broken. I agree. He is horny though, and learning to subtly self-fellatiate as feigned canine-meditation. He licks and edges and keeps a clean shop. How can it be more appropriate to act openly than talk openly?
