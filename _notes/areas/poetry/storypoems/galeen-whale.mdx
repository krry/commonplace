# Galeen Whale

Today I impersonated
the heir of a dead man.

He ceased to breathe
as everybody may
riddled with cancer 
in Madison
utterly mad
and his son
gave patient chase
while my sister dear
held space for them.

Galena
Dundee
Minnetonka
Ain't they moccasins

Stay probate?
Brothers don't resolve
to the love they sprang from
they remain in the ring
they grew all up in.
