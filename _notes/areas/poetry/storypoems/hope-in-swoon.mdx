# Hope in Swoon

Striding uphill
to the park
sunny Mission sidewalk
I catch me
moaning soft
replaying a shower
we took
each other in.

Rewind my mind
to Hope's superbloom
beneath the big cheese moon.
Witness a horse find his mate:
mare, tamer, rider, fate.

At first I had thought
the answer I'd caught
in a fleshy found rose
that I followed to you
at a gallop ecstatic.

The rose kisses your nose
and I'm cradled in beams
—metta karuna mudita uppekha—
reflecting, focusing
between our eyes wide.

I frighten and skitter
now sure that I have died
and fled hell into heaven
from without easy love
to endless inside.

Dachambo melts minds.
I scan for your eyes
entranced downstage,
periodically patrolling
for you and our rose.

Fast-forward one moon
and hope's back in bloom
and the stars in our eyes
could light up the skies.
Nuttin' to do butt swoon.
