# For Wilds Xmas 2019

May the
roads unfold unto Joshua Árbol
may the
rocks dance wild into skies full smiling
may the
roots fall hollow to follow the flow  (we know plays)
may the
sea froth lazily soothing our sorrows (and clouds vape)
may the
swiftly fervent slip neatly inhide
may the
black top ooze and smooth soles slake the aching
may our
water tanks tread enfold peace for the baby we've never stopped being

APIs defined
we've unfurled our vines
swimming now in light
we can exercise the might
we hide behind
cloistered cells of mind
we might fly if our wings
shared shoulder blades
or fleathers made of lygers
lygers churning sight into sound

levitate
levitate
gratitude
levitate
gratitude gratitude

May we all find a Shelly calm
May we all fly a wiley Kyle
May we all fit in Leo's story

🥰👺💓🧙🏽‍♂️
