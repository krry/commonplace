Dear Team,

I've been at SolarCity since January of 2013. There are few ways to explain this that will be safe for work. So I didn't.

Web killed the video
killed the radio,
killed the door

To door\*,
As they sing, we're headed straight for the same historical order of disruption in the energy industry that we have already witnessed in a countably obvious number of other industries.

A toast!

```sh
May your numbers be legion.
May your lives be the high kind.
May your efforts be tempered with knowledge of your success and your surroundings.
```

I love you,
Kerry

P.S. The iambic pentameter nearly killed my great-grandfather.

```sh
May sunshine and warm rain be with you.
May climates change slower than you do.
This battle is won.
Our schtick has been fun.
Our time has come, please watch the doodoo.
```
