# For ever and all ways

Seems simple
looking back:
Feet printed
next step and last.

Heal
Tow

Hoppin on
Carryin on
Fillin sails
Castin spells
(a la mouserat, singin about thinkin about feelin about)

One moonlit wander
I meet a hundred-fifty
whiskered
flippered
bards like me.
Bobbing on wooden
lily palettes
off Pier 39
We arc at the moon.

One moonless wallow
I let a honey hive me
