# Zine

But not hurd
I don't know what you're thinking
But I don't feel ZINE these days
Passersby continue
Site: unZINE
#51

Smiles smouldering under masks
we shoulder mild asks:
"Is this busyness essential?
How can I keep my ass covid
during a florking pandermic?
Where is the line
between social distancing
and socially distant?
Could I have been
anyone other than me?"

Resounding nose 👃
Big clearing sneeze
GAZUTI!
Tongue gaping stare

Can you smell what the
wookies on Kashyyyk
cash in for cookies
monsters dream big
stacks of plinko chips
Scrooge McSuckfest.
Fuck-a-duck.
Rest.
If…
If…
If…
Iff and only iff
there is no such thing
as taking a shit
we just give
even when we try not to
one third of a turd
ex. true. did.
