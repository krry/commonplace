# BaitinThe only fat hook I might be baitin’
will be left waitin’
while I’m celebratin’
mortality

Fake bakin’ flakes fellatiate
fellas fastly growing flaccid
while I flax it
I tisk it, I task it, I bask in it
fill a flask in it
black sin that it is
whack bubble and squizz, blitz the fist, quick diskin’ the pizzle mormon mazzle film and fazzle blaster. Squazzy flackle
missing some stoma closed for vacancy
blissing most hopelessly at home in the placency.
Look at your face and see
clasp at the space
beseech your home and nation, family grace
fadin’ expressly confess thee!
