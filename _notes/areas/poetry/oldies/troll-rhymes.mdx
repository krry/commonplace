The rhythm is my heart. My beat.
It becomes my beat. My heart's beat. 1 2 1 2.
Counting compression recession
impressed with my in session out of excess
shun the fuzz re un touch suns
No fun just wondering.
The misunderstandable blunders intend crud
Impending blood clogs the ave vein you's
perforate meaning perfect forest stations
burn faster than more rest full patients
with the patience 

the winner of the facebattle finna hafta eat a dinner
spinners on the razor scooter, pinners on the blazin' ear
grinnin' like the better pistol shooter in bristol
boot your shit-ass to the outhouse
got a moat around my boathouse and a fuckin mat at my gettin' throat house
maybe you now know hows I get down, turn a sad pussy's frown inside out
two white socks for my feet and a pink one for my skeet

We troll around in the murky waters of half-perception
finish avoid the shuns though, too easy
