I don’t know what I would say to you
But I’m sure I’d think of something
I don’t even know if you’d want me to
But I feel like I gotta do something
You’re probably thinking the same thing too
But I keep holding back, I do nothing

And someday it’s gonna rain
And you know we’re gonna get all wet (so wet)
And the castles of sand we’ve built with our hands
Are gonna crumble down, yeah crumble down

It’s more what I think and less what I know by the minute
With each passing day, my mind’s melting away, help me out
Gotta get out, I’m just wandering about while I’m in it
I’m battered & hurt, gotta dig through the dirt, gotta sprout
