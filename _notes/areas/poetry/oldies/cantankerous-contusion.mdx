not that the five fingered contusion, a cantankerous bruisin' that lingered left any confusion over who the king man spanker was

 that one took some pullin' like Chris Mullen tryin' to dunk over Olajuwan

me: I'll get a little, mail you some peel
suspended in spittle, frothy scale for fourthmeal
Joe: felt that the riddle made gruesome appeal
me: not just any little kid'll eat skin like a dead seal
Joe: chew on the middle like savory veal
dermis stringed fiddle with wavering zeal
 me: stew all the vittles in a pot kettle black steel
Joe: or toss on the griddle and watch it congeal
me: wormiest winged shit-heel with the blinginest greeeeellll
