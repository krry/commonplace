title: You Can Feel Me
---
# You Can Feel MePainful frickin' airplane makes me think about a Fairlane Ford
My pops would drive on two-lane roads
With me onboard as future hope
Put ya thumbs up ya nose and blow
now you know how an alien feels stowed below
In the cargo hold of a Boeing fold
-ed up like origami, but she really just wants her mommy
Tommy can you hear me
Harm her and you'll hear from me
Har Mar, you can feel me, I'm the best
This is the beginning of all the rest
And I'll be grinning if that's the best you can do
when I'm pinning humorous rhymes to your humerus
My subversive cursive verses send you and your nurses to hearses
First you'll burst from the worst thirst cuz I'm the dry sponge immersed in your water of life.
Turn your forked tongue bright orange, throat cursed what's worse?
My personal quest won't let me rest til I pop the heart in your chest. So
I hope y'all listening to Fat Ass spinning the hats and kicks that knock the birdies out the nest.
Yeah, I hope ya listening cuz what I spit's winning the battles the pick and the A's that I get on a poetry test
But I confess I'm a mess beneath my calico dress
and my mailing address is little house on the prairie
my Christian name's Kerry no I ain't a fairy Gary
marry Ace and his Ambiguous face
Fat Bottomed Girls gave me a great taste
so now I race to baste the waistline with my bouncing baby paste brine
C'mon baby taste mine it tastes fine
It just takes time like grapes make wine
