# Verse WorkbookAre you curious about Kerry S?
You'll be furious at my worry-less curry dressing
My chicken a la king chicks to knees will bring
Can you feel the tingling ring finger in your bouncing baby bringer?
Give me a single winger and ya see a grenade
Might think you got it made 'til the bitch's been weighed
But the bitch has been paid like Creole Lady Marmalade
Her stink pink was her trick sport fuckin her trade
Stay outta my shade witchya pale Yalie regalia
it'll fail ya when we whale ya Ishmael ya female genitalian Somalian
Ya bring me to the brink witchya Amateur shit stink
Enough for her clit dink
scared turtlehead's not poking out
hiding limp like a split mink
You don't think ya shit stink
With Roses like poo hoo
nose doses like woo hoo
Young Posies like you who
My tongue in ya hoo hoo
I'm hung til you boo hoo
Gogo ga Goo goo

Already I get down when I see her get up
Now I can see down where she keeps her C-cups
And I'm so down with Vickie's Secret pushups
I frown now, out loud now, how down now, get up!

Stop that cryin' boy, I didn't raise me no little bitch
Ya own dick is a fine toy, I ain't afraid to scratch my own itch
Don't wanna hear you whine coyly 'bout tryin' to park it in her ditch
'Cuz where you find joy won't be under the spell of some witch

So settle simmer down now no need to get up
Baby now you downtown time to hit up
Grab ya fellas who are down now it's time to split up
The magnetic forces between athletic whores's ankles
Keeping their pink pink and not white
Cuz black magic courses through my veins not yourses
Keeping your dick limp and not tight

So I wake up this morning
Break up a dream about scoring
When I notice what I'm ignoring
My own erection's imploring
"Please Head the Smarter go back to sleep,
Let me head a little farther into the deep
chasm where I can spasm
squirt in the dirt 
and the mud, you know you should."
He ain't as dumb as he looks
He's only worth what he fucks
But I'm nothin' without fuckin'
Bookin' nookie in a pickup truck bed

fo shizzle dizzel my nizzle fizzle bizzel
Painful frickin' airplane makes me think about a Fairlane Ford
My pops once drove on two-lane roads
With me onboard as future hope
Put yuh thumbs up yuh nose and blow
now you know how an alien feels stowed below
In the cargo hold of a Boeing folded up like origami
but she really just wants her mommy
Tommy can you hear me
Harm her and you'll hear from me
Har Mar you can feel me I'm the best
This is the beginning of all the rest
And I'll be grinning if that's the best you can do
when I'm pinning humorous rhymes to your humerus
My subversive cursive verses send you and your nurses to hearses
First you'll burst from the worst thirst cuz I'm the dry sponge immersed in your water of life.
Turn your forked tongue bright orange, throat cursed what's worse?
My personal quest won't let me rest til I pop the heart in your chest. So
I hope y'all listening to Fat Ass spinning the hats and kicks that knock the birdies out the nest.
Yeah, I hope ya listening cuz what I spit's winning the battles the pick and the Aze that I get on a poetry test
But I confess I'm a mess beneath my calico dress
and my mailing address is little house on the prairie
my Christian name's Kerry no I ain't a fairy Gary
marry Ace and his Ambiguous face
Fat Bottomed Girls gave me a great taste
so now I race to baste the waistline with my bouncing baby paste brine
C'mon baby taste mine it tastes fine
It just takes time like making grapes into wine
Like Grandmaster Flash, you'll be seein' white lines
on your face gettin' clearer everytime you look in the mirror
Don't turn penis envy to fear or anger like Margaret Sanger sitting on a bent coat hanger

This painful fuckin airplane makes me think about a Fairlane Ford
my dad once drove on two lane roads
with me onboard as future hope
safety seat umbilical rope
ten tons a Brazilian dope
help a gazillion loping mopes cope
nope, I haven't got any needles or sharp objects in my pockets which could injure you officer
I can tell by the cough it's her
the way that her bra fits her
the hourglass profits her daily in money
they may think its funny but this honey is twenty
thirty six twenty three thirty six o'clock on the dot
I hit the parking lot hot spot and whatnot
(aside) see my rhymes do the robot, one constant speed and they stop stop stop
and stutter under the rudder of a Ford Bronco mudder driven by Elmer Fudderdudder
I can't believe it's not nutter butter
I shudder as I spit out another milkbone biscuit
it was dark, I was lookin for a triscuit
a trasket I flask it the Mask did it just ask Ippkiss exactly this
(sample) "Who put the bop in the bop sho, bop sho" (echo)
And it drops you
