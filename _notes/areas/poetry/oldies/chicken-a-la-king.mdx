title: Chicken A La King

# Chicken A La KingAre you curious about Kerry Ssss?
You'll be furious at my worry-less curry dressing
My chicken a la king chicks to knees will bring
Can you feel the tingling ring finger in your bouncing baby bringer?
Give me a single winger and you'll see a grenade
Might think you got it made 'til the bitch's been weighed
But the bitch has been paid like Creole Lady Marmalade
Her stink pink was her trick sport fuckin her trade
Stay outta my shade witchya pale Yalie regalia
it'll fail ya when we whale ya Ishmael ya female genitalian Somalian
Ya bring me to the brink witchya Amateur shit stink
Enough for her clit dink
scared turtlehead's not poking out
hiding limp like a split mink
You don't think yr shit stink
With Roses like poo hoo
nose doses like woo hoo
Young Posies like you who
My tongue in yr hoo hoo
I'm hung till you boo hoo
Gogo ga Goo goo
