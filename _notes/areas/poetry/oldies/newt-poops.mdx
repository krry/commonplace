# Newt PoopsCandy and Froot Loops hide the piles of newt poops strewn willy nilly about the best of his roots; he stoops among the ramshackle ruins where gramms tackled bruins long before his short time. This biological sort of hate crime snuck past the myriad miracles of gam gams, her breakfast cereals and dum dums, toucas sphericles and bum gums.  No pet salamander could make the cancer unhand her, that big-assed bear-wrastlin gramma got hit fast never hastlin' to ram her hammer hands through the tumor that would soon consume her.  Toothless or not she chewed to the ruthless truth of his young soul and he felt his tongue swollen, biting down in memoriam while writing down her story and telling of the bitter fruitlessness of her inner foolishness.  How true is this? None.

In fuzzy memoriam of Grandma Ruth
