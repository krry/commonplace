# FaithlessFaithless

Sometimes you can smell it on ‘em
The way they wear their skin
Sunshine day on the outside of ‘em
Raging storm within

But I got X-ray vision
And you can shove your kryptonite
No I don’t mind the darkness
But I’m gonna fry you with the light

Cuz you can’t hide hide hide from me anymore
Yeah don’t even try try try to walk out the door
And you can’t lie lie lie to me anymore
Cuz you’re transparent, and I stopped carin’, and I’ve moved on

Their stench is overwhelming
Souls rotting deep inside
But the lay people are standing up
Gonna split this thing open wide

You can spit your game and your dogma
But I’m gonna throw it back in your face
We don’t believe it anymore than you do
So quit poisoning our race

And you can’t hide hide hide from us anymore
Yeah don’t even try try try to walk out the door
And you can’t lie lie lie to us anymore
Cuz you’re deceiving, and we stopped believing, our faith is gone
