# Hurding

Swollen molting folded hands
band together slam
sliding van doors
capture fans
or their prana, their auras
for reasons, for raisins

my dog friend ate a grape today
and he's fine
but Hey Google sez he's a goner
AIs can know everything
except the truth
must be tough
being an artifice among art

This book of poetry has one line

> What tastes worse with bacon?

and the rest of the book is space
held for the dialectic around a dilemma
that troubles minds down to the base
camp of the him-a-layers
