# A Modest Proposal

Hello dear,

**I need you here.**

Long as I remember,  
three questions  
no one can answer
rattle and roll.

Questions we all ask  
over and over  
or leave to echo  
behind our minds.

- Who am I?
- How'd I get here?
- What do I do?

On the *4th of March*,  
the questions crystallized,  
the answers arrived.  
Struck by enlight'ning.

I've done nothing since,  
except shed delusions,  
spread love,  
and breed bliss.

**I live here now**,  
in a persistent state  
of Continuousness.

**All I want and need**  
is to share (everything) with you  
conscious wonders!

So I come (you come, we come)  
bearing gifts,  
however you like:
- a poem
- a sigh
- a hug
- a gaze
- a song
- a dance
- a wink
- a game
- a laugh
- a drink
- a book
- a year
- a cum
- a dish
- a bonfire
- a trip

Receive.
WTFU.
Wake tfu. (Wake the fuck up!)  
Breed bliss.  
Keep breathing.

No tradesies,  
no bargains,  
no charge.
 
Self-rejection over.  
Lost and gone forever.  
Denial dried up long ago,  
sold you down the liver.

Trust me please.  
First consent.  
A second of bliss.  
Safety third.

I need to know what you need.  
I need your queries  
and queernessees.  
I need your verve and  
the coordinates of your vertices.  

Your modes of reception,  
your ears,  
your smile,  
your spit,  
your grime,  
your hate,  
your love,  
your willingness,  
your abilities.
