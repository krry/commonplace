# Unwind

Nothing to do.
Nowhere to be.
Nowhen to live.
We are here now.

"I'm eighty percent there
on a time machine,"
he whisperfucked my ear.

"I'm ninety percent sure
fate has brought us here,"
the scroll exhibit closes down.

Fate is what we find
behind our ears
when nothing rings true
or clear to me and you
and these impossible wonders
occur naturally.
