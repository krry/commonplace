# Lasermothfeels

I aim to be
one who reminds us 
what our hearts sing
who cures disease
with faithful breathing
and tames the seas within 
to crash upon our shores
as butterflies land on your nose

I aim to find the same
one spilling with sacred latent bliss
that smooths our hair
and pets our nooks
and fills the hills with dusky wonder
as a bee alights on your knee

I aim to create this too
one spouting with music
who runs up and down
the dawny dusky hills
and sails the waves of ever
loving kindness and grace
as a lasermoth sits with your heart.
