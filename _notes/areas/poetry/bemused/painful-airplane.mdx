This painful fuckin airplane makes me think about a Fairlane Ford\
my dad once drove on two lane roads\
with me onboard as future hope\
safety seat umbilical rope\
ten tons a Brazilian dope\
help a gazillion loping mopes cope\
nope, I haven't got any needles or sharp objects in my pockets which could injure you officer\
I can tell by the cough it's her\
the way that her bra fits her\
the hourglass profits her daily in money\
they may think its funny but this honey is twenty\
thirty six twenty three thirty six o'clock on the dot\
I hit the parking lot hot spot and whatnot\
(aside) see my rhymes do the robot, one constant speed and they stop stop stop\
and stutter under the rudder of a Ford Bronco mudder driven by Elmer Fudderdudder\
I can't believe it's not nutter butter\
I shudder as I spit out another milkbone biscuit\
it was dark, I was lookin for a triscuit\
a trasket, I flask it, the Mask did it just ask Ipkiss exactly this\
(sample) "Who put the bop in the bop shoo, bop shoo" (echo)\
And it drops you
