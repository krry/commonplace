# One day I want this kind of time

This time now, this time will do.
The hard ground below me please.
The barely there air eager to breathe.
Filters fresh: skin, lungs, eyes three.

Hairs longer, spirits higher,
I step into the craven vacant space.
Expect nothing, intend nothing, just be.
Tickle my ears, debase me. All vibes welcome.

Eyes moist, glittered with dried tears.
Mind sound, unfettered by healed tears.
Legs strong, arms open, loins prime.
No why's, just dive, try, survive, thrive.

Today was tomorrow yesterday.
This kind of time springs eternal.
We pause or we play or we stop.
It is as it always would have been.

Not basic, but treble af.
