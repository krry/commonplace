# Sank

I was dead for four minutes give or take
Went through the green spot
And came back laughing

Then coughing
For the next eight hours
Till she broke my will to die

Drowning didn't scare me
I feared the love that was sleeping
So I held my breath
until I could face it
bathe in it
dissolve in it.

Her tubby hubby brought me back
with the beating I deserved
he and his brother took turns
cracking ribs to reboot me.

At the hospital they gave me morphine
then napalmed my flora.
She stayed with me, hooked me,
saved me, and blew me
(the next word is not 'away')
on the edge of the hospital bed
until I came to be able to breathe
this clarified, rarefied air
the skies comprise on the otherside.

With my guts wiped clean
I could trust them again
So I began to agree
with what my heart sees through.

A thousand days later
I'm still shedding, molting, purging
the crazy I let them make me.

But now there's nothing to do
about/for/to
anyone/anybody/everything
but be the wakened love
I died and became
when I sank.
