# Grandma Cecilia's Sports Banter

Good score, runnerman!
I root for the home team:
a seasoned ticket.
Root root root!

Glad you grounded out.
You were a high fly ball player.
Hunker in the dugout.
Ninth, bottom, two out, two strike.

Slammajamma!
Sidelined. Pass it in.
"Double dribble!" says the whistle.
Eleven down and thirty to go.

Linebacked!
You'll have to wait at the end of queue, B.
Sneak out of the pocket again
and I'll sack your punter.
Twelve and goal.

Hat trick!
Thirteen of fourteen in the series.
Third slap shot in the five hole.
We're gonna need a Zamboni
in the penalty box.

Touch down, teammate.
Epic tailflip pop shove-it
aerial combo you landed, Tony.
You're going to the X game.

Bend it to my call and beck.
Hammer that pig's kin.
Foot. Ball. Roll
under your slide tackle.

We're here for the Sports Ball.
Shirts up, skins down.
Onsight that route. Send it!
You can lead off.
I be laying you.

Spikes down if you steal.
A base line stroke
leaves it love love.
Two hands when you backhand.
Foul! In the paint.
Free throw.

Time out. Two left.
Sixth man is first
off the bench. Warmer
turf helps with grip.
Safety! Third
period, timeover, back in.

Run home, Jack!
