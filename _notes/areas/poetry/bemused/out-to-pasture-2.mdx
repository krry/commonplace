# Out to Pasture

🐎🦚🦅🐝🦗🍑🕉️👐🧵

Before me spread
green fields of wind-waving
inseminators,
grasshoppers,
pollen nuzzlers,
nectar slurpers,
furry burrows,
bee-stung fillies, &
mustang whinnies.

Beside me stand
hearty steeds,
worthy mounts
whipping tails
they cannot see
at flies they believe to be
biting our fine asses.

Behind me slams
the gate between
here and stable.

Within me run
a herd uncounted
swirling through
a grain-wide tube
of whodat whatsit food
for curios, egos, you
as the grey Fates tug
the thread I stride.

Above me fly
wilder, keener eyes
aloft on weathered wings
ready to tuck in
to snatch the chance
our beastkind hearts
pump the beat of Being,
Knowing, Enjoying to grasp.

Onto me swing
legs slender tired,
voice, brass inspired.
I sprint to drown
out the shouts whose
echoes follow
canyons carved
out by spectral streams
flowing from the heights
of wrongness thawed.

Under me lie
the dust of tries
once tuned and drawn
now scattered back
to rest upon the path
we sweep clean then litter
as moonlit night
reminds us of scales
without balance
and scope beyond hope.

Of me become
worldwide eyes, satellites,
meadows thundering thighs,
hearts awash, parties surprise,
patios fart aloft seas high.

Fasting, slowing,
feedback loops arise
as we tire of exercise.
Therein resides our demise.

This hoof shall clop,
sera sera,
the 'aye's have it,
'no's ghost.
