Here ***it is*** in a nutshell
or rather, here's the nutmeat,
pre-shelled and split:

This time when I woke up,
I really woke up.

From the last dream
as real as an echo
The Work,
done here but before,
grabs the reins just as
Mind begins to wind.
Setting seems familiar.
Memories flood in.
Mind rakes in the legos
and snaps the set together.

Mindset and setting attained.

I know who I am
and what I am doing here.

At least I think I do.
Let's do The Work.

#### Is it true?

Eyes stay shut.
Minimal new data.
No glaring gaps in narrative,
memory accessible, if cloudy.
Cohesive timespacemeatbag.
Pleasant enough agreement matrix.
It's true.
Yes.

#### Can you absolutely know that it's true?

The last dream seemed just as real
as present memories of yesterhere.
Desires still tug me thence,
goals set and unmet,
promise made and unkept.
Memory leak detected.
Physical reality invalidated.
I cannot absolutely know it's true.
No.

#### How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?

I snap to it,
get with the program,
act the part.
I take stock,
tally resources,
review agreements.
The next move occurs to me.
I feel stuck in a role,
reduced from unbounded love
to a mere puppet,
a muppet.

The dream becomes the dreamer
waking into a fleshy cage
cowering in a psychic cave.

Today I feel underwhelmed,
swamped in humdrum soup,
unfulfilled and suffering,
on the verge of surrender
to an unknown nameless foe.

The hurt wheel turns as fear feeds blame spawns guilt breeds spite fuels fear.

#### Who would you be without the thought?

The dreamer, methinks,
though if I were
to do The Work
about being the dreamer,
I might end up
someone else
or no one.

I'd be
generosity, the dance,
serendipity, the song,
opportunity, pure joy,
the full being smile.

### Turnaround

I know who I am and
what I am doing here.

I don't know who I am.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
