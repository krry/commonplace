# this is it

Here we are now.
You and me, young tree.
I attend you.
You attend the sky.

They say your roots mirror your branches.
May we never see.

We soak in the rain together.
We bask at high noon.
We bathe in the moonglow.
We breathe one another in.

They say when one finds a teacher, it doesn't matter what they teach.

I stand as you stand
Hope to branch as you grow
Dream to be in bliss
