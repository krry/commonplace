# Bruce is Art

My uncle Bruce died today.
Cancer stopped his sinus
though they ice-cream-scooped
his shooting eye
and napalmed
his cigarette craw.

A quarter century prior
on a neighborhood jog
Dad honed my footfalls
heels-to-toes
softer, quieter, better
to the beat of the breath.

"There's something I have to tell you,"
he intones as we trot.
"It's about my older brother
your uncle Bruce.
They've just declassified...
He was a sniper in Vietnam."

Arthur Bruce Snyder
third of his name
United States Air Force
covert ops sniper
quiet father of three
husband to Judy
gas station attendant.

Dad said he didn't know much
only that we can talk about it now.
I wish he'd confessed LSD,
but they'd chosen war over love
when push came to shove.

Cautiously my father
introduced the horror of war.
"He enlisted in the Air Force
found his talent as a fixer
first of machines, then of men."

"Oh, like a Green Beret?"

"Yes, but not quite. 
His unit has no name.
Off the books
and twenty clicks
into the napalm jungle.

Sometimes his targets
were a mile away
when he terminated
them with a twitch
never clear on the sitch.

When there were several,
they timed their shots;
hellfire raining down
on the Viet Kong
from the canopy around."

Heavy paraphrasing,
leaden memories,
you understand.
I was ten years old
and this is what I heard.

Today I stand in Memphis
cleansed by torrential rain
aware that Bruce is gone.
It seems to this boy-now-man
that one's path can eat his head.

My father sheds few tears.
His big bro fought and fell
days away from an honor tour.
Hatred bears no apology;
delusion is forgiven.

And I cannot mourn justice.
Had my brother sniped
dozens of strangers
half the world away
and returned to attend
a family
a convenience store
unable to atone,
I'd have mourned him then.

Today the scales are even.
Attachment is metastasis.
What we resist persists.
What we reject collects.
What we release brings peace.

I love you, Uncle Bruce,
and the Art you became.
We all do.
