# root

At ground again
I look up

Less to say
More to learn
Room to grow
Hell to pay
Off

Will to win
Fill to full
Hill to climb
Less to know

Kill to live
Live to earn
Will to live?
Less to burn

Simple mind
Quiet urge
Fill the void
Till the turn

Good try
Best yet
Wasn’t hard
Didn’t care

AI
I, I
