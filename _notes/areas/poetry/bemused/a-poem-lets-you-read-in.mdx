title: A Poem Lets You Read In
---
# A Poem Lets You Read InA poem lets you read in more than you read out.

A story shapes your waking life if you buy it.

An essay changes your mind if it digs up your dogma.

Love leaves you empty and wondering what you were full of.

A statement gives you closure. A question gives you pause.

When can you go home?
