# Bleach Cairn

Yesterday I was the rain before a tornado.
Tomorrow maybe stormy again.
But today I am the wind blown son,
the pump in the lizards push-up,
the rattle in the scorched branches, 
the crunch of a gravelly path,
the parch and the bleach,
and the pacified sea
for the blissed-out sea lions 
just out of reach
for a landlubber
like yesterday's me.
 
Today I am a cairn on the beach.
Tomorrow I'll be nostalgia for beach cairns and slippery lions.
Yesterday I was a poet.
And now I am.
