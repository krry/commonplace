# Alit in Paris

From up here in your aerie
I can taste the winds of change,
la meilleure baguette
sacrilegiously schmeared
in Rocamadour and Rockford.

Up here I can hear hearts ring,
struck by the here and now,
frozen in rosé,
open to those who play,
punsters practicing the dance.

Up here I can see the truth
that you and you are one and two;
that bliss has bred a vessel;
that eyes met santé
as the days remain today.

Up here I can feel the flow.
So don your white wingtips and
let's have another wedding.
This ceremony is within another
and your love is now in me.

- for Estelle and Josh following their third wedding celebration in June 2018
