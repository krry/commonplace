So I prepped for the Burn
—phenylethylamine test—
Night owl plays guinea pig
Lone warm cage. Twenty megs.

Rainbows wash the walls.
As the dynamo spins up
in that shithole apartment
I bob, laugh, buzz fuzz.

Flowing into the dance
of the kaleidoscape source
I laid the last beads
of solder on my specs.

Welding goggles ringed
sparkles addressed within
each flash nearly random
eyeful diodes at nanotime.

In that marvelous universe
my memory slipped and fell
and failing to recall the first
I took a second test.

The buzz became thunder,
lightning root to crown.
Ego perishes, self dissolves,
Eyes drop to whose feet are these?

Ba-thump, ba-thump, ba-thump.
Am I this echoing heart
Hands smear my face as
seconds stretch to eternity.

Heartbeat races and halts,
terror chills and burns.
Huddling under blankets,
shivers, cowers, sweats.

"Who would this body be
if this mind passed away?"
body heat spikes and flees,
dry mouth, rubber knees.
air, water, heat, food;
make it through the night.

Strip down, draw a bath.
Test the temp, and again,
slurp air and release.
Remember to repeat.

Grimy blinds bleeding in
redemption, dawning, 7 a.m.
A voice within sings a hymn
"Praise the Sun. Live again."

Seeing jeans onto legs,
then shoes upon feet
a hand meets a doorknob,
and wind fills this sleeve.

Stalking unseen
down Valencia Street
as the workers commute,
the sidewalk same as feet.

Orange hand, white man
speeding car flies past
shoes, pavement, tires
sun, wind, sky: all one plan.

Not sure where I'd gone
or where I come from,
made it back to the body
