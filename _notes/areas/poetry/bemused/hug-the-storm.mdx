# Hug the Storm

The breeze soars up the hill
up my shorts, up my nose
and I grin
wrapped in tiny tornadoes
tickled pink in sunbeams.

My arms embrace each other
around this throbbing beat.

I have grown bold enough
to hold the storms inside,
to cradle the chaos I comprise
and so have grown young again.

For pure potential love
has no aging bones to creak
no monkey mind to ruminate,
and no achy heart to break,
only possibility to be
come what may to pass
as we burst awake
into the dream
that gave us each two eyes,
and now three.
