# Baby Catcow Blues at Dawn

Peel your baby blues 
crystal light clouds
engorge
water balloons
impact
water socks
flip flop
what size shoes
are you
this human year

who is this
super new manatee
dawn of humanity
Helio's sister thee
Jupiter drop
of mystery

Xerxes transimperial!
Alexandra and her
curandero guero
as Clio pattered back
and Tony's boss angel, a
tigress you 'fraidies
wouldn't wanna cross
her mess thrice
no shame ennui

flowing frothy gorges
fury forms on Raw
sun-gotten blossoms
busting columns
jesty poofs of awesome
nocturnes tied up
in hot car-window
sweat lodge-mobiles
hanging on nursery hooks
cursing the witch
who would besmirch our mirth
oozing goopy birthday cake
frosting ice cream cookie
melting in the velvet delta
right when the moon incurs
clear sight of you Oona
(Ooh, no?)
worthy heir to me and Her

Burst out of surly skirts
round willow nerve inter
her queue, lean fervently
ergos in certain shoes
ethos in scatterprint
ecologuesmattering
dust patterns flatt-en-ed

Till up the o-o-tids
filter for better kids
scoot off the loom
sprout of the loins
we thrust craven
towards abyss within

Silly subservience
humble mush
pervy ex-cuses
sail on yet another
stint betwixt
desperate heartbleets

Who can admit defeat
willingly wanton
begin to bow modestly
cow cat cow cat dog
lion horse bear owl
phoenix rise
into this realm
