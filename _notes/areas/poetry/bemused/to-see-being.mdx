# To See Being

So I prepped for the Burn
—phenylethylamine test—
Night owl plays guinea pig
Lone warm cage. Twenty megs.

Rainbows wash the walls.
As the dynamo spins up
in that shithole apartment
I bob, laugh, buzz fuzz.

Flowing into the dance
of the kaleidoscape source
I laid the last beads
of solder on my specs.

Welding goggles ringed
sparkles addressed within
each flash nearly random
eyeful diodes at nanotime.

Then the 2C,B overcame me
and I tripped into the light
fantastic, ecstatic static
ceasing doing, seeing being.

In that marvelous universe
my memory slipped and fell
and failing to recall the first
I took a second test.

40 mgs of 2C,B means OFD.
Nothin could've for what went down.
The buzz became thunder,
lightning root to crown.

Ego perishes, self dissolves,
without a shell, I melt.
Eyes drop to where my feet were.
I become the ground they meet.

Ba-thump, ba-thump, ba-thump.
Am I this echoing heart
or the witness of its beat?
I start to fray and freak.

Am I breathing anymore?
Or is the air breathing me?
Hands smear my face as
seconds stretch to eternity.

Heartbeat races and halts,
terror chills and burns.
Huddling under blankets,
shivers, cowers, sweats.

A voice from the well
cries out to be saved.
"Who would this body be
if this mind passed away?"

By this point I've lost it
forgotten how to breathe,
body heat spikes and flees,
dry mouth, rubber knees.

At half disintegration
a strategy ignites:
air, water, heat, food;
make it through the night.

Glug a pint from the tap.
Strip down, draw a bath.
Test the temp, and again,
slurp air and release.

Trembling in the clawfoot
hot enough to steep tea
exhale follows inhale.
Remember to repeat.

The voice calls again
from the shadowy deep:
"This is your life now.
Full freak achieved."

A towel dries skin
and the twain have met
fluid fields phase in
around, from, and through.

Grimy blinds bleeding in
redemption dawning, 7 a.m.
The voice sings a hymn
"Praise the Sun. Live again."

Seeing jeans onto legs,
then shoes upon feet
a hand meets a doorknob,
and wind fills the sleeve.

Stalking unseen
down Valencia Street
as the workers commute,
this sidewalk is feet.

Where sidewalk meets street
no difference is seen
sun beams through skin
restoring lost heat.

Another spectre looms
ahead, gaunt and beat,
its flesh falls away
bones dust, being stays.

What is left is a need
to see and be seen
to love and be loved
to breathe and be breathed.

The next strolling thrall
—this can't be for real—
melts to skeleton crumbles
its light being revealed.

Orange hand, white man
speeding car flies past
shoes, pavement, tires
sun, wind, sky: all one plan.

Eras later the well flooded
and the voice bobbed up
so I dipped in my bucket
and filled up my cup.

Not sure where I'd gone
or where I come from,
made it back to the body
I worship as home.

And now I am that light
and the eye in between
this well within
of possibility
and the need
to see being.
