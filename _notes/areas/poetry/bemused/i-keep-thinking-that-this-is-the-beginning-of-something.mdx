title: I Keep Thinking That This Is The Beginning Of Something
---
# I Keep Thinking That This Is The Beginning Of SomethingI keep thinking that this is the beginning of something. That this new perspective will call in the winds of change I've been dreaming of since I was young. It ain't gonna work like that.

A tadpole wiggles
as the current reminds it
of the present flow.

I know how it goes. All I have to do is remember, acknowledge. Anything is knowable except that which does the knowing. My memories of the past and the future are well-shaken (that is, poorly developed) polaroids of other moments than Now.  I can step away from or even leave behind most of the agreements that comprise my mind.

Hollow tree echoing
informs the earth when it hears
we are all loopers.

Everything, every word, every deed, every wink and nod become natural and easy when I admit who I am. Effort is what I apply to beleaguer a lie. The truth lies in the belly of my shell as I turtle forth.

One blue headband could
lead this green foursome forth from
the cloaca within.

I fucked up today. Again. I knew it immediately, felt it. My heart sank, my knees got wobbly, my chest seized up, and refused to breath. As I grasped, my body alerted me all the ways that I did not want to be grasping. All I wanted was some more irish-cream-drenched coffee. Sweet creamy beige. You ever drunk Bailey's out of a shoe?

Out I passed, away
from the clutches of ego.
Long live the liver.
