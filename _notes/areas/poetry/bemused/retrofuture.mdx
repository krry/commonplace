# RetrofutureRetro-future. Future perfect.

It is as it always would have been.

We needn't force it. Those new things under the sun were there already. We've been sapient, hunting and gathering, for millions of years, but always looking over our shoulders wondering who said what about me or her or him. The stories we like, the ones we tell and retell collect us and ordinate us into corps and incorporations. If you agree that we are all made of stars and that culture is made of stories, then you are telling yourself my favorite story: 
the one that got us here, the one that will carry us onward.
