# Right at Home

I awake to a shriek of joy.
A gallito ca-caws into the dawn.
"Excuse me, Kerry? Do you want to build a house with me?"
I yawn out the karaoke courage fumes
and tumble toward the Legos.

"What are we cooking today, Chef?"
The imperfect produce begs us to curry.
We craft a recipe for Akupara, a co-operative foundation,
a world-turtle swimming to the dawn of consciousness.
"Damn, that looks delicious!"
The curry has our favor.
"Yes, Chef."

We know how to change our minds.
And so we have.
Heading: love by love west.
Lay in a course.
Follow the indigo lad.
Always be asking.
Smash the black mirror.
Howl at the moon,
in tunnels, for shiggles.

We all begin as he has
a stranger in a strange land.
A lucky few find the spice,
yield and reap and sow it.
It is a dance, Muad'dib.
This is our song.

You're never in my way.
But sometimes we're near,
and that's awesome af.
