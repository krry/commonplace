# Sundrown

"One more drink and I'll
know what to write"
has never been
the case but I've
foughten the fight.

Wisdom comes from whiskey
or is it dumb?
To think that
simpling down
will make me come
up with higher minded lies
beneath my fuddled sighs.

Wax my backside
holes to soles;
it feels familiar.
Holy Sol burns
tires outside
parked on driveways.

The next part is about a hard time I survived.
