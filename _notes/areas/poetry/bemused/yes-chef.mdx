# Yes Chef

We're on a boat and
we're trolling slow an
we've got a *bonne* to *soirée*
pass me the *rosè*.

The spice closes two
then opens three eyes.

Have Love
Will Travel

Lay in a cause for celebration.
Mark the center of affinity.
Set intent to "wander with chakras wide open".

Bonjour santé
santé santé santé
bon soiré.

Hear ye Muses,
Hear ye Hustlers,
Mystics, Monarchs,
Pioneers, Players.

L'Imperatrice
et le Bateleur
become the Bard,
like two Cats in the Wild.

We'll start at the Nein
and spiral-cut our way back up
to where the bacon sizzles
along the middle coast.

Giggles rain slam
Rain slam giggles
Ukemichelleo Man
Mid-roof fiddles

Yes chef we can
has coconut milk from a can
CanWorks.com sends an
Ice Cream Unicorn to your home
with a big dull knife

What are we cooking up next?
