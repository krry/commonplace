# Give It Up, Horse

Save it.
Whatever you're about to say
dig a shallow trench
loll your tongue
against your bottom
incisors,
trace the crooked crags
impervious to vice
stained with... fuck it.

Hock it up
right in the trench
from the diaphragm
gob that juicy nugget of gorgonzola
into a putrid missile.

Give it a throaty sneeze
fire what you were about to say
into the pitiful crevasse
you've fingerscraped out
in the guttermuck.

Give up.
You've got nothing
to add to the wonder
abounding around.
It's enough, far more
than the prizes
you could hide behind
any third or second door.

Toss it in
your sad towel
that you tote around shamefully
sopping with fap sauce
and cigarette sludge
and smart kid juice.

Leave it.
You don't need to keep
trying to be eloquent
when you could fall
back on the nothing
you have come to mean
to yourself.

Give it up, horse.
No one needs carrying.
Their burdens are imaginary
and your friends are real
open to the pain
you saddled yourself
without wit, feck, or ruth.
