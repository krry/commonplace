# Sonnet #1

"Yes dear and you could just not be so shitty,"
I said then redacted, recounted as false
to the moon who had tugged at our tears with its tides through
our flubbers and leakings that bloodied our waltz.

Up into nothingness, black as the night,
where the bats spin and dive to the buzzards who thrive
on the willing indifference shackled and slight
upon wounds we entomb, lick, and scrub till they're ripe.

This flame flickers morsels on down to our graves.
Give me no laughter. I hear it as false
as our ill-conceived babies ceramic away.
'Til we cum or come clean let's rub in the salts.

"Same same but not different," I screamed to the breeze.
We awaken ma√±ana to buckets of G.
