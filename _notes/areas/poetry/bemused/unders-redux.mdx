# Unders

bananahammocks
or prudish frocks,
slings and thongs
for dangles and dongs,
thingies in dinghies,
pampers, diapers, doody didies
backup wipers, tighty whiteys
polka dot can-coozies or
cheeky checkered cheekcheckers
floozy floss or booty bands
bubble wrap, front and back
box bag, package pouch,
peanut pocket, cashew couch,
kielbasa casing,
roast beef baggies,
tiny tuna tins,
muffin cups and honey pot pans
holders for boulders and
mittens for kittens
fruity looms or pooty tombs
(insert your wombs)
bloomers zoomin' 'round the room
superman or looney tunes,
my little pony, house of poon
gimme strawberry shortcake,
cotton is a nice break
from satin and lace,
chafing the waistline
boy shorts hearts racing
balzacs steeping
time for tea bag tasting

all this time I'm wasting
expressing drawers and dressers
should be releasing your tresses
and teasing off your dresses

I confess my best efforts
still imagine you undressing
I swing in your private
primal jungle swooping
on your silky vines
your curves and lines,
purple and swollen,
blushing from red wine

my printer ran out of toner
so I wrote this with my boner

- Kerry Snyder, 1999
