# Foolsherd

## Sugar cows
Excuse themselves without an offense
Pass by dreams and joy for cud
Deny nerves fried and tempers flared
Stand into the aisle just after landing
Mutter "sorry" as they pass nearby
Slow down traffic
Halt progress

## Plastic sheep
Queue without question
Avoid mixing a booze with another booze
Drive to work alone in a herd of same-same
Watch their and others' cholesterol
Count ounces of water and calories
Are supposed to expect they should blame

## Brand pigs
Memorize commercials
Jangle jingles
Vote for American Idols
Dance with the Stars
Spend the holidays making purchases
Erupt into popcorn radio karaoke
Arrive early for the trailers and trivia

## Being humans
Speak truth
Travel light
Dance for joy
Love recklessly
Embrace strangers
Consume experiences
Ingest the information
Grow lovers and friends
