title: Same Cannot Be
---
# Same Cannot Be## Same cannot be

Our sensors fail us.
Catch a snowflake on your tongue.
As beautiful, unique, it is.

Caress a nape.
This one has never been touched.

Even as you taste this flake,
as you pet this, or stomp that,
or as you sniff a stagnant clutch,
it has already shifted.

Change has you.
You are changing.
Range reckless,
range widely and far.

But do not despair.
Don't pull away.
Same cannot comfort you.
A same simply cannot be.
Sames ain't.
Nothing equals anything else.
No one else is you.
Nothing else is this.
Let it be, this too shall pass.

I'm no poet, though I claim to be a writer.
I sift through titles,
appellating instead of masturbating.
But I don't appellate. I am no apple.
Jobs didn't want a job.

I am a Snyder.
A Snyder is a Schneider dulled.
A *schneider* cuts, slices through.
I bear the scars of incision far below my skin.
I grasp for other purposes while I could be embodying my own.
I hope you do not struggle this way.
My gently buried wounds bleed.
I cry for "us" far too often.
My Brita filter tires of me.
I watch its work spill on my shirt.

But there is comfort without equation, without question. Comfort in the question, comfort in equation.

I'd like to think there is **an answer**.
I've struggled to formulate a proper question.
Don't for a moment think I've ceased the struggle.
Any word I read pours through my metafilter.
Any vibration I perceive feeds first into that soulful maw.

It turns out to be simple.
It doesn't matter that nothing is equal.
It doesn't matter that sames are not.

What matters is quite opposite:
	There is no equality.
	And because of that everything is beautiful.
