the pen is mightier
a ton weightier
the penis might eat her
the last straw ruler
—so fond of you manatees—
fronds a blue planet

a pencil vester
measuring each word
tends to tongue weight
dons a camel back to
the next hill crester
a feather dustier
a pensive sill rester
who weathers busy birds
expensive silly nesters
absconding with comets

the free world leader
owner of a load-free heart
always brings a towel
carrying member
ships
magnet to magnates
to dearth star clusters
consumed with busyness
gives pause, cares, shits
appears in your parlor
sparkling in the din
of your dank tv den
