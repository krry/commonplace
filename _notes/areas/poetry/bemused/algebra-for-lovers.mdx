# Algebra for lovers

## Order of operations
Pair
Envelop
Mash
Descend 
Achieve
Subside

Parenthetically, YMMV.

## Commutativity

A + B = B + A

Anyone's a slut.

## Associativity

(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)

You might as well share.

## Transitivity

If A = B,
and B = C,
then A = C.

Wrap it up.

## Distributivity

n*(A + B) = n*A + n*B

Climaxes should be mutual.
