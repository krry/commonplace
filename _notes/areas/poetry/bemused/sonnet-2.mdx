# Sonnet 2

Yambic pen. Damn it! 'Dat blouse done 'sploded
hams and I'm one-handed lambasting noobs.
Tail me to Zanzibar, Freddie knows now who did
Brexit and Trump found somebody to Louvre.

Sonnets are toasted and monkeys trick lions
when words couldn't signify shit or shinola.
Better to clam up and feel like you're flyin'
than shouting '(b)out maggots who feel me like no love.

Tres quatrains deep and I'm feeling my keyboard.
Lyrics en flique starboard port green red meepzorp.
Pound puppy stank on my feet cuz we sleep four
Deep on the couch though the third and the fourth gone.

Dream lucid with me and shake spears on entry.
You'll regret "did nots" and these shrugs are free.
