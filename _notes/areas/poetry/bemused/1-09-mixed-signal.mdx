## Track 9
# Mixed signals

It wasn't coming through.  
You had no way to hurt me,  
except leaving.  
  
And you didn't leave,
but you could have and I  
made sure you were assured 
of that future history.  
  
At times a signal arrives,  
and at times we can respond.
But most times we have no answer,
and can only reside.

The future has been written  
as it always should have been.  
We'll find our angels' demons  
as we confront the ones within.

Our problems are old.  
Our struggles are new.  
We are aging.
I can do nothing
but intertwine with you.
