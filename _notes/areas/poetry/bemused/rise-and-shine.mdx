# Rise and Shine

Awoke.

Breathe in.
Pull with the belly:
Light tumbler whirs.
Fill hollow chest.
Creativity swells.
Top off the dome.
Gracias brimming.
E-minus 20.
Release.

Be here, now,
gently empty.
Pause in the buzz.
Submit to the void
till despair sinks in
hale and hearty.

Hope brings a refill:
two lungfuls, abundant.
Soak in the symphony
of ten quadrillion
mitochondria singing
thanks for the O2, yo.

Respiration resonance:
Three canons
in the round.
Roll over,
find ground.
Rise and rinse
warm then cold.

Bend in half,
single fold.
Lunge at youth,
feel less old.

Chaturanga dandasana.
Urdhva mukha shvanasana.
Skip or hop to tadasana.
Embark.
Embrace.
Empower.
Elevate.
Exalt.
Retire.
Repeat.
