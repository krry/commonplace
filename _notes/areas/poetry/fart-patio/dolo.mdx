# Dolo-a-gogo
## Song time words

Here we are. Sun is up.
No one returned my smile
as I strolled to Dolores.
Braved No-Way Valley for a mile.

Repressed intimidations
leave us rowing slow
wondering when
we light our glow.

Jangle macaw
jungle my craw
Fill the sky
colour on wings.

Alight on King David.
Dirt nap Goliath.
Swallow your stones.
Give us presence.

jangle macaw
fill the sky
.. every other line  ..
.. refrained profane ..
