# Christies

My mother gave me two friends
twins inscrutable
Michael and Jonathan
and not in that order.

Their lil bro Chris
helium tank birthday boy
gutted it out
stage 3 by age 8.

Father Bill
brought agent orange
to Robbie's womb
from Vietnam,
from jungle traps beyond.

He founded Subways
franchises for cookie monsters
I now thaw to believe.
