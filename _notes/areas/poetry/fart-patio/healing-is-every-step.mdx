# healing is every step

This too shall last.
When do I begin?

How is my past any different
than what will come to pass?

Seed becomes tree becomes seed
as egg chicken egg cetera.

I feel the heft of ancients
weighing on my simple fee.

The smile we share
defies the dust we are,
another moment upright.

I'll be now,
you be here.
