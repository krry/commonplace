As a conscious agent
rooted in love
I wield two abilities
attention
and intent

Attention I direct
to what matters
this then that
always new import swells

Intent leads attention.
It is as it always might have been.
But I try besides.
Watching, loving, abiding.
Intent is set as I rise to wake,
sprouting to be the love
from which I spring
as light fills my eyes.

My attention follows
and defines my experience
of being knowing enjoying
this gem I embody.

I cannot count attention,
but I account for it
with every breath.
