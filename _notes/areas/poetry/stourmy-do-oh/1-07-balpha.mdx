# Balpha

First letter I know? "A"
Second word I know? 'alpha'
Second letter I know? "B"
Third word I know? 'balpha'

What happens when alpha allows
itself to be subject,
to be object or victim,
to be hurt or mistreated.

Third letter I know? "G"  
The rest will flow out of me.  
The pause I've given myself?
Let it rest, and lie with you.

We'll be together soon.  
I'll balpha your aeta.  
You'll consume what I produce,  
and in kind I will as well.  
  
My dearest hope is  
to find you powerful.
First word I know? Open.
