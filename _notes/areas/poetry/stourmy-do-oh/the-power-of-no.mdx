# The power of no

You say yes
And I say go
You may curse
But I can't know know know

Know-oh-oh

Figments of
painful past
dig their claws in
burrow up your ass

No-oh-oh

I don't know.

Always wond'ring,
Fawning, feinting
Whirling, wanting
Hurting, hating
NO

I say "No"
You say "Go!"
I say "OK"
You say "I don't know…"
Oh no…

Grimace last.
Your words stand.
What's it worth
if our twines won't outlive, outlast?

Outcasts!

Whirling, wanting,
feigning, flaunting.

Oh no-whoa!

Hurling, whirling
Failing, faltering.

Oh no…

We spend our time
unsurely opening.

Oh, oh.

We might be stars
if we shine on too.
