Many poems start with a cliff
step to the edge
tiptoe to peril
this one offers a safety net

a new cadence can be bought
currency aside
fluency is all
we need to aim for

full stops or partials
these stops are pauses
only temporary
like anything
safety flees too

writing songs hugs melody
writing poems hugs spirit
foam up foam down
time for a soap and a bath
