# Battles Resolve
## Track 6

We needn't fight.  
Those were said.  
Our lines are crossed.  
Our heads were bred.

Lines assembled,
stark afield.
We puff our chests  
we shout like chieftains.

Our old loins simmer here.  
Our new lines foster hair.
Our lines endure.  
Our beards get thick.  
Our frowns drown our jewels.

The hardest fights leave   
the deepest scars we could  
ever hope to survive.
But battles are fought  
and battles resolve.

> inspired "I Shot the Sheriff" from Bob Marley
