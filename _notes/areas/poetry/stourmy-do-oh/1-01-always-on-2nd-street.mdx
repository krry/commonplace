# Always on 2nd Street
## Track 1

Each step I take is careful.
Each word I breathe is true.
Every note I write is garbled,
not putting you first, like I do.

For you
For you

Walk with me down this next street.
Take my steps, take my shoes.
Take my life for all I care,
just use it well
as we traipse on Second Street.

You're not first and neither am I.
And that's why
we're astride in-step.
As high as you might be,
as deep as I could go,
we're always walking down Second Street.

For you
For you

In all honesty, to be true,
literally, I digress.
To tell you the truth, I'm come collect.
I'm somnambulant inseminate.
And you? Feminine divine.
Follow the yellow brick road back to me
up or down that Second Street.

I couldn't sleep if I wanted to be.
But with you, the best I see.
So I stroll, I pave, I lay down
the Second Street I've paced and plodded.
It's for you. Not for me.

For you.
For you.
