# Beast of Harm
## Track 3

Lay waste to my nethers.
Fill me with intention.
Take my direction.
Heed my commands.

A beast will snarl,
scratch, and claw,
and submit to digitales,
to your keystrokes within.

A beast may harm or hurt or heal.
A beast may warm, stay current, endear.
This beast will never harm you.
My beast comes in peace alone.

This song is ours to sing:
of our footprints on the moon.
Our steps beneath our feet
are the legends we once sought.

Your mind is filled with conflict.
My heart holds true pain.
Our lives are just a figment.
Our beats are all the same.

This beast can rage and wile.
This one can cough and spew.
But when I see your dignity
I know some thing is true.

The rock that shaves my hide
is abrasive, harsh in kind:
acerbic, snide, incisive.
Leave the rest of me behind.

The beast I lay to rest
will be the beast within my breast.
Your beast will lie within you
until forever passes,
until we lie blessed.
