# Calling out

I'll holler if you'll have me
I need your feedback
I need your input
I'm one small mind compelled 
to upend our over-turnings.

You have the wisdom
You lend the grace
We'll coalesce into beauty
I'll dissolve into your face
I'll look after your kingdom

Give it to me rawly
Slide it over bare
Rub me raw, chafe my hide
I'll wonder why later
And bask in your friction

Will me away if you must
Or guide me down a pretty path
Wish me stronger, wish me smarter
Will me on down to your briar patch
These thorns are not for you or me

Absurdity defines us
Strange will guide us through
Your aroma is my essence
I can smell your kernel
