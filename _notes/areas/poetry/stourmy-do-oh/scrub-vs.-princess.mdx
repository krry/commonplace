# Scrub vs. Princess

That time has passed.
Why consort with simpletons?
You could be swinging in empires.

Never mistake a scrub
refugee for a princess.
A scrub spreads wide
but not wise.

A princess spreads wise
and just as wide
for her true prince.

It's time to ride,
you know that.
A future you see
is dark and full of terrors. Let other lesser
men confront them.
Let her spiral down,
while you ascend.

No time for fools,
for time is all we have.
There are fools among us,
none to be acknowledged
or to be conceived.
