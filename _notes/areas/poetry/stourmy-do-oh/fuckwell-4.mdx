# FUCKWELL 4

We could take in some of the Weekendâ€”
nicely indelible reflectabilities.

Some houses shelter ancient dogs.
Most temples skirt weak sauce.
It's hard to convey why not.

But the message is clear:
smells good is good;
body swells to mate;
love everyone so hard and soft.

Dear Lili,
I would tour a Scientology Celebrity Center with you.
I only ask that we can leave this record,
before we infiltrate the organization,
and fulfill the goals the universe has set.

Who else just came?
No one?
Let's fuck ourselves.
Siri-ously.
Just like you like it.
Really dial in.
As though your finger/tongue
wasn't governed by cerebrum.

Thousands of youngsters fit the part.
Trying hard is the ouevre the French meant to import.
