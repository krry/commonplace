# We're on the other side

I'm a confidence artist
but I want nothing from you.
You've asked for it all,
fuck all that we've been through.

We're on the other side.

TB ain't no joke
HIV don't lend hands
HPV, is she with me?
Hep C done kicked
my old girl's old man.

We're on the other side.
We’re on the other side.

Tell me how heavy is it,
Sisyphus, are you with me?
Rolling boulders to hilltops
Can I give you my hightops?
Or roll with you. I’ll push too.

We're on the other side.
We're on the other side.

What can brown do for you?
I skeet on sisters too.
Then she found a sister too.
I got inside someone new.
We want the same thing, the sane thing.

We’re on the other side.
I'm on the other side.
I'm just another snide one
with a thicker hide.

And seek me if you want,
but be ready, son, I will be too
I'll be a fierceness that you never knew
I'll bring rain pain and brain mass
I WILL COME THROUGH
and you will never stop me
as we always knew.

We’re on the other side.
