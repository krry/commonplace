# Fuximulation

Here I am.
Some parts you'll recognize.
My eyes and ears and arms are
open wide.

Here we go.
We're trying to feel our way from
inside the shell that once was
(me/you in harmony).

We reconcile:
as hearts
as minds
as apes
behind blue eyes.

I'm sorry I crossed your path.
I'm happy we came to pass.
We're over the moon and back.
You wear a ring, and I am the last

of my kind.
If you hold your hand in mine
I won't feel so low.

All I know is love.
All I know is love.
All I know is loving you.
