# FUCKWELL 3

My heart grew butterfly wings for you.
This stage was extraordinarily painful.

A heart needs no wings;
the arms do that.
Corporate wonks like PowerPoints
because children mind.

Your evolved aura has reset my perception.
I drown in your presence.

You rise as I dream.
I crave your sense.
Bivalves could choose a slant.
Crack my shell.
