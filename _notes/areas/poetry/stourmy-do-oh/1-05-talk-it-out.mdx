# Talk it out
## Track 5

Next step, place a foot.
Left or right, plant a root.
I'll shade your tree  
or earn your growth.

Papa Moses said we  
won't talk about it,
but I think we will,
if I have a last request.

It's hard to say what we do.  
It's hard to do what we say.
The fuzz I've grown  
will keep us warm,
until the dark shall part us.

I will be open until I pass,  
until the veil descends.  
I will be here  
until the sunset fades.

Shield your heart as you must.  
I'll peel mine in due time.  
Your feelings are everything.  
Your mind is my hourglass.
