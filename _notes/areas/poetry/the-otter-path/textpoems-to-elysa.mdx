# Textpoems to Elysa

A leotard for me would be a heleo

🙂 I have an idea for a harmony experience that draws like a spirograph, sounds like a theremin, and lets people swing on pendulums (pendula?) to make the art

So this superfly
food truck rumbles up
and it goes like 🎵🎶
tacoburgerpizzaicecreamsandwich
and then a 🌊 of wonka fog
catches up with it
washes over me and you

🌊🌮🍔🍕🍦🥪🌊
🌊🍦🍕🌮🥪🍔🌊
🌊🥪🌮🍦🍔🍕🌊

we bob in its wake adrift
in hawaiian ice mist
for our skin sun-kissed
on tongues awag
from mouths agape

I don't think you're a good boy

Just a typical run-of-the-mill boymanbearhorseowlion

SMS may be async
but ESP is FTL

any beach will do
black sand, white sand, blue
skies drenching coconuts
palms
wave
massage
island blossom essences
onto sun-kissed
dorsals, fins, flippers
lips greet body heat
naughty dolphins
remora clean

I remember burying
my face in your nape
only hours ago
and catching a whiff
of why winds blow

But my skin still echoes with your smooth soothe and your firm yearn

As the placid lake
welcomes the quicksilver moon
I've pooled for you.

There's a wiggly rivlet of untameable heartglitch in the ocean of chaos we swim and are such hapless blippity blops of. Oh to be a hard beaked bird on the breeze until the wind picks up and moles have the cozy holmes

a full moon is nigh
a time to reflect
to allow the way
to resolve on the surface
of the bottomless lake
of eversoul as it turns
to glimmering glass
in the shimmering glow
of Gaia's sleepy silver sister
