our space is safe
for all our feels
from sad to happy
to pink and purple
or wordless squeals

and as we face
the feels we make
we state with grace
which we want more of
and take the next step
towards the rising light

and should we find
ourselves inside
the sudden shadow
of a closed third eye
we sigh like feathers
forgive our failure
and wink until a smile
breaks the salty icebergs

sea lions can't be sealed
beneath the crusty glass
we'll take the otter path
we'll play with fire and ash
