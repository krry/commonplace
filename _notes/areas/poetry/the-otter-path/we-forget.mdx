# Cosmic Jokester

we forget
it's all a joke
as we age
ossify
decay
delete
then
unabortyrself
sorting hat
wage-slavery/Pokemonsterdom,
mortgage/career/petmode squad,
kids, hit bars
rattle the cage
of the, has this been
a play pen
the whole time
you fuckers
tall swine, loud,
na'er cloven enuf
quick with the slip
broccoli belly beef
lengua chocolat elite

got serious there
for a midnit
choked on my own giddup
flucked up a quick stain
aint not a nare nawwwrin
could contest jest
the goo we came thru
the who that made you, you
unthrew up from a turgid
tube screwed up lube and pubes
formerly ambulating as a male human
"I, as male, made culture,
since I am scared shitless
of how you poop babies,"
a cretin once misparaphrased
Camille Paglia. Extent of ignorance reached. Back to reading...
