# Triggered isn't a feeling

Forklempt is a feeling
it starts
in the floral lemptoreff
and crochets
our ancient anger
into/unto
this
holy
begotten
forking
doilie

They say it slow in church
because it's been a trick
for a thousand
hang on
two
thousand
years and now that we're
cosmically stargazing
it coulda been millennia
since any one questionellleedled

why come alphabet?
size doesn't matter.
have a need? yell ???
never stop asking ???
those who do end up aging
again and aging again
and before that they
spoke Latin
oh wait
no one did
the same way no
une parle Ingles

Triggered is a thought
that usually entails
anger
which is a feeling
a hot one
inspired to change this
it not fine
it ain't fair
toenails get shitty
topknots sprout hop on
Hugh has long wondered
why come this
whhhaaaaa

We notice/think the word "triggered"
when our body receives a signal
aka a change occurs like
this moment held
aka fubumagu
