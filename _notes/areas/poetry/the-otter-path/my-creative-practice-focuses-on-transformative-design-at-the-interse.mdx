title: My Creative Practice Focuses On Transformative Design At The Interse
---
# My Creative Practice Focuses On Transformative Design At The InterseMy creative practice focuses on transformative design, at the intersection of arts, healing, and technology. Current mediums and projects range from interactive ecg-powered bio-adaptive art installations, to haptic vibrational assistive wearables for treating trauma and ptsd, to immersive experience design for transformation and development, to collaborative teaching partnerships in design and personal transformation. Currently, I teach at the Stanford University d.school, create as a designer/artist-in-residence at Google, and hold an Edmund Hillary Fellowship. 

The target audience of my work ranges from those suffering from grief and loss to survivors of deep trauma and ptsd. Upcoming art experiences for 2020 include pop-up interactive art installations in locations of deep trauma and recent mass shootings: such as Christchurch, NZ (through my EHF Fellowship in partnership with the NZ government) and El Paso, TX (my hometown), to sponsorship with Reimagine: End of Life to partnerships with emergency first responder trauma units. 

During this residency, I aim to focus in three main areas, though I also leave the work open to emergent projects and experiences as they align with the students’ and professors’ collaborative areas of interest and expertise. First, a large-scale iteration of the “One Last Thing” art installation and related immersive art installations to incorporate aesthetic algorithmic solutions to biofeedback from the experience. Second, a set of medically-tested user-friendly fashion-forward, meticulously designed and crafted, mechno electro bio activated smart textiles jewelry wearables. And third, a workshop, course, or student design project under the umbrella of healing and transformation design and the integration of engineering, aesthetics, and heart-first human design. 

The “One Last Thing” interactive art installation, created for the Reimagine End of Life festival, offers a space - a portal -  for participants to communicate with those people and those relationships they’ve lost. “In loss, a soundtrack often repeats in our heads, if just once more I could… hear her laugh, feel his kiss, be held, be felt and understood…” This exhibit asks, “What if you could?”  

This installation is in its second iteration and has, again, been invited to be a part of the Reimagine End of Life Festival in New York. Through this partnership, the installation will ultimately be housed at NY MOMA, The Holocaust Museum or the 911 memorial. Though the installation has been well-received, I ultimately, envision a much larger and much deeper immersive version of this experience integrating biofeedback enabling the artwork to have real-time adaptive and responsive impulses. I would love to partner with students to brainstorm, design, and develop this type of biogenerated integrated experience. Additionally, the next iteration of this installation also includes a collaboration with the Emmy-award winning experience designer, Topaz Adizes, and “The {   } And” interactive storytelling experience. Students would have the opportunity to join in that collaboration.

Simultaneously, through a partnership with SBCAST (Santa Barbara Center for Arts, Science and Technology) I am prototyping and designing smart haptic biometric driven wearables for health related issues including but not limited to trauma, ptsd, and autism. Early uses of the haptic vibrational technologies also suggest great possibility in the design of incubators for premature infants, a topic which might be explored with the Olin students. The collaboration with SBCAST gives me, and Olin students, access to unique, IP with haptic, biometric driven technology, medical research and engineering. Here, there is opportunity for students to design the full user experience from ux/ui, hardware, and software, products for the home and hospital, and more. Furthermore, access to SBCAST offers access to patented vibrational healing technology through wearable prototypes, habric floor/environments and aquatic technologies. 

Beyond medical and personalized wellness applications, the haptic environments offer inspiring spaces for collaborations with dancers and choreographers as designers of healing movement and kinesthetic healing. I would love to see how students respond to a design provocation which asks “ How might a space, vibration or movement provide deep healing and transformation? What if we could choreograph movements for healing? What would that look like? Feel like? How might you bring non-movement oriented participants into a movement-based experience? What would be inviting? What would might be transformative?” 

A past collaboration, The Colorbox Project, began to look at these questions. The Colorbox Project was a kinesthetic immersive arts experience, a collaboration with a Hollywood film maker, computer scientist, data visualization artist and myself - the textile and experience architect -  where we integrated questions about cultural implications on emotion, movement and expression and used data science to aesthetically parce meaning. With access to new resources at SBCAST and new expertise at Olin, I’d love to see how these types of experiences might evolve and develop.

A successful year at Olin would incorporate all of the art installations, wearables, and other healing experiences into a ‘concept’ car style gallery and holistic wellness space with arts leading the experience from beginning to end. The portfolio of projects would culminate in an immersive healing experience and non-traditional art show to be held on campus. Research and findings from the interactive art installations and wearables would offer best practices for the design and development of holistic research-backed healing spaces in trauma treatment centers. 

The on-campus immersive exhibit would act as an inspiring space for incubating a new future for authentic mental and physical healing. It would be a provocative space where we could invite practitioners, architects, doctors, healers, and trauma victims to experience heart-first human-centered nurturing healing spaces. A places where students could envision the future of holistic arts-infused science meets spirituality, east meets west, authentic intuitive integrative health care and wellness. A space powered by tactility, aesthetics, somatics, and kinesthetics. A personalized biofeedback powered experience. Students would have the opportunity to interact, collaborate, design and engineer this experience through a variety of inputs including but not limited to ux/ui, software, mechanical, product, design, experience design, and art.

I am profoundly lucky and grateful to have earned a degree from the Joint Program in Design at Stanford. The program is and was incredibly unique in its partnership between the fine arts and engineering schools. I am unaware of any other program in existence, then or now, that does the same. However, the invitation of creative-in-reference program at Olin, bridging art and engineering, hits that magical creative space between these often silo’d practices. This makes this particular creative-in-reference incredibly exciting! And, I believe, also makes me a uniquely qualified candidate to empathize with and educate this next generation of creative engineers.
  
In a class of 16 masters candidates,  I was one of only 3 students to graduate with a Masters of Fine Arts (my peers earning Masters of Engineering degrees). The MFA degree as part of the design program at Stanford is no offered. I was fortunate to be one of a select few MFA’s to collaborate, take courses with, and graduate with a group of engineering students. As an arts-first practitioner, I had an incredibly unique perspective and process as I completed my graduate program and thesis work. 

In fact, my experience as a student, even within a program that was meant to encourage and create safety and collaboration between artists and engineers turned out to be highly variable depending on the professor. I had some who told me I belonged in art school, not in the Stanford Design program. Some who told me my work didn���t ‘count’ as a designer because it took a human/art-first approach versus a scaled engineering impact lense. Sometimes, it felt like I was on a tennis court, being hit back and forth between professors’ points of view and areas of interest, rather than cultivating my own voice and confidence in being, thinking, and acting differently. 

My mentor David Kelley, founder of IDEO and Stanford d.school, once told me that Matt Kahn, the lead arts and design professor -the keystone arts professor - prided himself on graduating ‘unemployeable’ art students. At the time, I didn’t fully understand what this meant. Effectively, this meant growing and developing students with a deep sense of design, aesthetic, confidence, and purity of form and purpose. This training both gave me a strong ethical and aesthetic appreciation for craft and form. But, also, made it incredibly difficult, and near impossible to understand how my skill set fit into traditionally industrial forms and jobs. The truth is. It didn’t fit in. It still doesn’t. 

Years later, I’m grateful for that. I now love to be the provocateur, the creative misfit, the one ‘in residence’ never truly fitting in or falling into accepted norms, always holding space to think and act and create differently. However, it was many tough and painful years finding my way as a creative, carving new roles as an artist and designer-in-residence at unexpected places like Google. I had no mentors working in a similar way. I had no role models for how an artist might fit into unconventional settings. Traditionally, artist meant, and still often looks like someone trying to sell artwork to galleries.That definition of artist doesn’t work for me. Traditional constraints, places of practice, and obvious collaborators didn’t appeal to me, and definitely don’t make sense in today’s rapidly changing world. 

The opportunity for creative transformation sits outside tradition. Creatively, in between. In between, I’ve sat at conventional tech and engineering tables- while still, holding an arts humanity-first perspective. Often, in fact, holding the perspective that my tech colleagues didn’t consciously understand as my strength, as the reason they appreciate my perspective. I’ve nudged in and found ways to bring arts and aesthetics to healing medical devices, to making form, function and experience a thing of beauty and not one of wearing the shame of a medical device. I have found ways to integrate technology into arts experiences for human-centered kinder experiences. I have learned to use technology as a tool, as a color on the palette, not as a means in and of itself. 

My unique experience working as an artist in tech, and as a designer creatively engineering art experiences, makes me uniquely situated to create relevant and inspiring educational experiences, to give students real world authentic arts and engineering based learning experiences, and to provide them at least one example - me - of how one to be a creative chameleon speaking the language of arts, creativity, and engineering. 

I love teaching and I love collaborating. I often think of my modes of work as a venn diagram, one circle for my arts practice, one circle for my teaching practice, and one circle for design and impact collaborations. The description of the creative-in-reference is incredibly exciting to me. I absolutely love teaching and collaborating with other professors - wherever my global work and projects take me - I always make it home for spring quarter at the Stanford d.school because my soul is so deeply fed by being on campus with curious students and experimental professors. I love the freshness of possibility that students bring when they haven’t yet experienced “real-world” industry constraints. And, I know how to gently steer students into creative, yet realistic, solutions spaces. With regard to a ‘porous’ practice and a collaborative space in the Library, I can hardly imagine a better campus set-up. My studio spaces are always in collaborative open/doorless workspaces because I thrive in collaborative environments. I’m fueled by the energy of other creatives working nearby and the possibilities that spontaneous brainstorming and close proximity makers offers. Furthermore, the Library sounds like it could be a fabulous space for live on-campus immersive prototyping. 

While I am now able to build and dream of a personal portfolio which integrates conceptual emotional-fueled arts experiences and transformational medical devices all under one umbrella of practice, this was not always the case. In school, I was encouraged to explore one path, deeply; otherwise, run the risk of being accused of being chaotic and haphazard with my focus. It has taken me many years to make sense of all of my areas of focus and experience, of an authentic arts integration beyond a museum setting. I wasn’t given many examples of how arts worked in collaboration with engineering, not once I left school. Not once I started applying to traditional roles. 

The school of hard knocks, the ‘real world,’ learning how to bridge the gap between arts and engineering, arts and industry, in keeping my creative soul fueled, it is through my own curriuculum, beyond school, that I can bring my experiences and teaching to the Olin students to help them learn to carve their own creative paths. I am excited to bring an arts-based design thinking challenge to the Olin students and would be thrilled to collaborate and teach at any point in this transformative design umbrella, whether focused more on user-friendly wearable/fashion design for new haptic solutions to immersive transformational spaces better integrating biofeedback and adaptive biometrics into healing spaces.
