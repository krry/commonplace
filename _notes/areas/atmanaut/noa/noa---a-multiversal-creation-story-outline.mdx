# NOA: The Creation of the Multiverse

I'm obsessed with the big questions. The questions that plague non-believers, and that believers answer with faith. I refuse to give up and go about my life on false premises or without answers. Belief and ignorance are equally dissatisfying to me. Dogma is the true devil among us.

## Why does anything exist at all, instead of nothing?

Nothing does exist.

Nothing knowing and loving itself becomes everything.

In short, love is the answer, and knowledge of self.

## Why is the universe finely tuned for the emergence of intelligent life?

As we observe closely, we discover that it has a very specific configuration. Various parameters, constants, and natural laws are delicately balanced which dictate the structure and dynamics of all we experience. The speed of light, the fundamental forces that hold the planets in orbit (gravity), that keep objects from passing through each other (electrical force), that holds the nucleus of an atom together (strong nuclear force), and that powers stars and radioactive decay (weak force), the If we construct a mathematical model of the universe and vary these parameters, constants, and natural laws, the model doesn't work. Life would not Who is responsible for this?

## What happened at the beginning?

There was no beginning. It only seems that way to us since our awareness is tethered to an impermanent manifestation of existence.

## Does God exist?

Yes, as much as you exist, for you and the Creator are the same.

## What caused the Big Bang?

Causality is an unfalsifiable tautology that scientists and logicians hold to support their model of reality. It is likely that causality does not exist, at least not in any pure form. And it is not imperative that the Big Bang had a cause.

That said, the Big Bang, or however you would like to imagine the origin of our spacetimeline, represents a particular configuration of universal parameters and natural laws set in motion.

## That's where [[noa]] comes in

### Being Nil

- all possibility: potential, vacuum energy, superposition
- no actuality: shapeless, dimensionless, featureless
- pure information: void, chaos, sunyata
- examples of the Void gives rise to the Light, the Word, etc.
  #needSupport

### Knowing Oneness

- pure awareness of being, of self
- nil knowing itself becomes all
- reflection and projection split one into many
- set of all possibilities
  - infinite dimensions are possible
  - infinite universes are possible
- examples of Creators, Demiurges, Brahman

### Becoming All

- differentiation emerges
  - one becomes two becomes four
  - relative qualities co-create each other as the One subdivides into All of the Many manifestation of Existence
    - with light comes dark
    - with hard comes soft
    - with old comes new
    - with big comes small, etc.
  - spacetime functions as a ticker for differentiation at the Planck scale, enabling the quantification of change
- chaos resolves into order
  - entropy measures progress
- iterating through the possibilities
  - could be represented digitally in binary
- within the tree of possibilities, our universe represents one branch with certain fixed parameters and fundamental laws which determine: - our possibility space - the structure of our reality - the dynamics of our reality

### Playing Me

- awareness is pervasive
  - not everything is self-aware
  - but awareness could arise anywhere
  - the structure is a nested hierarchy of membranes
- known awarenesses share certain characteristics:
  - Cellular
    - identifies with its membrane
    - aware of what passes through it
      - distinguishes inside from outside
    - individuated, distinct perspectives are not shared or divided
  - Functional
    - sensing - accepts signals/vibrations as inputs
    - evaluating - processes the value of information
      - using algorithms that determine the change in wellbeing of the:
        -     primary membrane
        -     internal environment
        -     external environment
      - may keep logs of inputs and evaluations
    - emitting - offers evaluations as action/feedback
  - Agency
    - able to alter algorithms and choose feedback
    - directs attention
    - sets intention
    - takes action
    -     values wellbeing
      -     has thoughts and feelings about wellbeing
        - pleasure
        - pain
        - emotions
        - language
      - self-preservation is instinctual
