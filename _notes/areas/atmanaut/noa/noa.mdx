# N/O/A

# Nil/One/All

## TL;DR

     playing me
       being nil
     knowing self
    becoming all

## Existence 101

There is nothing.
Tathata.
Sunyata.
A void teeming with potential.
An infinity pool of possibilities,
all deep end, no bottom,
no surface, no water.

Just being knowing nothing,
knowing itself
loving knowing.
All possibility assembled
reflection eternal

What a catch
lies within my grasp
seize sure thing

# Christ in a Hottub

what they don't tell you about hitting bottom
is how you don't feel it.

when your last breath is cool hot tub,
better the Pledge was tepid.

heights don't scare a fool in love.
Should the moonlit shallows?

did I apnea train for this?
Turn to the appendix,
under 'houdini'.

this is where the magic happens.
guns don't crack ribs, people do.

notice the bony cage,
imagine what landed you here.
notice the bubble of rage,
imagine what sleeps at your defeat.

i laugh my first breath back
why my Prestige ain't tears?
what soul did I sell?
more years, less ears.
