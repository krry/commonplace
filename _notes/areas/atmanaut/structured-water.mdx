# Structured Water

Gerald Pollack's theory of a fourth state of water beyond vapor, liquid, and ice.

Theoretically a pure gel state that naturally arises in the cytoplasm within cells.

When water molecules align similar to the iron molecules in a magnet, other non-water molecules slip out of the polarized water, which Pollack then calls EZ (exclusion zone) water.
