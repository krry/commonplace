# The Whys Behind our Is

## A Tour of Love and Fear

Today we're going to do some tracing (mainly back, so we won't need a pencil or tracing paper). The pathways we will follow have long been laid, though they may lay undiscovered in dust and dirt and muck. And as we mine down to the bottom of our well of being, we may want to ink indelibly those pathways we discover that serve us best. I provide some blank portions below for this purpose.

Here at the onset I want to posit a simple framework: every choice we make is rooted in either **love or fear**, and often both, but favoring one. We may find that we were unaware of considerable tracts of fear, or that the compost fertilizing our will to be free is a lovely, musky loam of love. Either way, this tracing exercise will exhume our motivations and leave us poised to be picky about the "Why"s behind our 'I's.

Now we'll tour the realm of the experience of being: field by field, theme by theme, some uniquely human and thus imaginary, and many quite universal and real. First, let's give our fields a quick fly-by:

- **Movement** — [[An animal tends to wiggle. Why do we dance?]] [[We live to dance and dance to live.]]
- **Desire** — Are we born to want? Did we want to be born?
- **Food** — [[deuterostomes]] seek to fill the middle hole. Why eat what?
- **Sleep** — Eventually one must rest. Yet we often can't sleep. Why come?
- **Play** — Mammals learn through failure. But where stops the game?
- **Self** — To be self-conscious is human. Of whom am I self-conscious?
- **Family** — Every forest has its roots and seeds. Profoundly involuntary?
- **Morality** — Authorities are like opinions. Who do we heed?
- **Mind** — Cogito ergo zoom. Are we better mindful or mindless?
- **Money** — Time = money = energy. What makes the world go 'round?
- **Work** — It's all fun and gardens until somebody has a whip. Why work?
- **Health** — We've got it till we don't. How do we weigh our ghosts?
- **Sex** — 1001 Recipes for Tiny Death. Are we making love or sowing fear?
- **Marriage** — Nothing lasts forever, except this stolid institution. Right?
- **Legacy** — All this suffering has to mean something to someone someday.
- **Mortality** — The deathly end lies unawares beneath the shroud. What matters?

Surely there are more germane themes to discuss. We will let them arise naturally, as mushrooms from a rotten log.

## Movement

Motion is a fundamental truth at every scale to every flavor of observer. The universe dances alone within us and through us. From the charm quarks and the strange quarks all the way up to the quasar-devouring supermassive black holes and all manner of manatees in between, Nature abides nary a wallflower. So as soon as awareness finds its seat in the well of being at heart center of a new body, a move is made. Being becomes its ever-evolving self yet again.

One can conceive of an infinitesimal cosmic tick, the so-called Planck unit of time, which contains the most minuscule observable alteration. Just one bit flipped in the endless tapestry of information. And letting the model extrapolate, allowing bit flips (a.k.a. choices) to cascade and propagate, one can model the realms of being in [ten dimensions](https://www.tenthdimension.com/).

As actor-observers participating in this grand drama, we know little for certain. We pay attention and notice the state of being evolving. We intend a change and events unfold, sometimes reforming the state of being according to our intentions. Meanwhile we witness countless other events we have not intended, giving the distinct impression that the game is afoot and _multiplayer_.

The wind blows through the leaves of the gingko biloba tree standing nobly in our backyard. Who intended this playful flutter, this cool caress? Many models of the world we encounter assume the primacy of humanity. We euphemize them as anthropocentric, as human-centered, but often they go much further, excluding the possibility that any non-human beings could possess even our most rudimentary faculties.

Dogs have an excellent sense of time, may even read our minds. Trees send each other aid and gifts via the mycelium network. Dolphins frolic and fellate, and octopi MacGyver.

The pepper plant in my garden stretches toward the sun, seemingly with joy and in gratitude. Could it be so? If we can interface with the mycelium in the soil, we may discover a biotic internet of trillions and trillions of conscious beings attending and intending to form the forest.

Stargazing as I lay upon an enormous boulder in Sequoia National Park after a long hot August day along the Big Arroyo, I could feel the stone offer its stored heat to me and receive my body heat in kind, as gracious and grateful for my presence as I was of its. Could it be so? As the moon rises from the horizon, its glow blinds me as it basks in the hidden sun's shine.

Gurdjieff tells us that the Moon feeds upon the souls of earthly denizens, fueling her evolution. The Earth grows us for this purpose, and only a select few terran lifeforms become aware of their unconscious plight and still fewer achieve the sovereignty necessary to defy the Moon, salacious and drooling. The Moon shows us only her face, never her back, so intent is she on consuming those who give up the ghost. Her insistent tango about the waist of fertile, abiding Gaia tugs our seas into swells and churns our skies into squalls.

Bone-propped meat balloons such as we are, we comprise mostly water ([99% by molecule](https://www.pollacklab.org/research), 55-75% by mass), so suffice it to say we feel the Moon's pull as though we embody the seas themselves. With enough force to hoist the very oceans three meters closer on the near side of the globe, the Moon isn't subtle. And the Earth at 81 times more massive exerts a profound draw on the Moon's dusty pockmarked face, a force of attraction so intense in fact that the Moon can't look away, but lolls transfixed and hypnotized in quad-weekly rings around Earth's scintillating blue-green skin.

> Shrouded within every dancer, we find **_the beat_**:
> the sticks of the marionette
> metered to our hearts
> pounding and breaths sucking,
> to the wind blowing in the sky twirling,
> to the Moon swooping, the Sun soaring, and the stars trawling.

Life experiences motion, I hope we can agree. Life moves, often under its own volition. These voluntary movements follow the beat of our body, of our world, from a lizard's pulsing pushups on a sun-drenched stone to a moonflower's pungent nightly blossom. Tempting though it may be to ignore the intent of nonlinguistic lifeforms, I urge you to attempt a risky inversion. Instead, let us look everywhere for intention. The beat goes on seemingly without a drummer, but the steps don't dance themselves. Even the swooping Moon, in its enormity and sleepy regularity, with eyes that blink each millennium could be seen to quiver and wiggle in response to the Earth and the Sun in their waltz about the galaxy.

Digressions indulged, we come to the point. Why do we move? Why does everything wiggle and dance? Could it be that the a program executes the dance, each of its steps a discrete command carried out? If we select our steps but follow the beat, do we dare conceive of ourselves as the only willing dancers? Do we dare defy the beat? We can feel the flow as pressure when we resist it, and as easy release when we join it. By attending to our flow states, by noticing what steps fit the beat and which trip us up, we can begin to glean the drummer's motive.

I notice, and the seething roaring masses of seers and teachers of being through the ages corroborate, that we flow when we move with love and without minding. The guru sits gazing upon all sides of a universe dancing to the one true love song. And when, instead of love guiding us, fear pulls our strings, pain pings us to return to the beat. While _what is_ makes grandiose overtures of love to _what could be_, though every sunrise and every sunset offer us a watercolor spectacle, and despite a worldwide (and sadly dwindling) chorus of birds tweeting about the beauty of being, fear often cottons our ears to the music, fear shuts our eyes to the Whys behind our Is. Fleet though we run, we run to or from. Love is slow, love is patient, love is kind. Love waits, knows face

As ones who aspire to move consciously with noble intent, we can ask before, after, and during any act, "Do I move to love or from fear?"

## Death

Each death we might meet is tethered to a particular birth, with countless immalleable events strung between.

We often misinterpret the immaleability of the strands of reality as temporal-causal directionality, as the Arrow of Time. The simplicity of the Newtonian billiard-ball model of causality seduces us. Surely with enough register tape we can account for the past and future history of the universe in a grand litany of "if this, then that" statements. And perhaps that tape would tell a cohesive story, albeit one of the practically infinite set of possible stories.

Gazing upon the quantum experience of being from the past or the future reveals this taped litany as a single indelible strand, a chain of events. Yet pausing within the timeless present moment, we can swim among the possibilities, twanging the manifold strands that thread through the eye of the needle of Now. An endless chain of choices lead us to this one. Each of those choices was an explosion contained and channeled along this strand, defined and distinct among the innumerable other strands along which even the slightest variations in intention and manifest action would have channeled us.

Do you see why we cannot afford to condense time into a line? Do you see how the premise of conscious choice, of free will, creates a branching web of nearly endless possibilities? Do you wonder who freely chooses and who mechanically executes their programs? Does the soulless thirst of the Moon blow the very winds, whipping the seas into waves and swells, whisking the skies into cloudy dollops teeming with bolts of fire ready to rain down upon the tinder beds of ancient forest floors?

Could it be that a body thousands of billions of billions times more massive and billions of times more primordial than my meager water balloon stretched over rubber-banded bones —— could that immense and ancient body be also tremendously more aware, more intentional, more intelligent than me? For the Moon weighs in at a supposed 7.346x10^22^ kilograms, and has celebrated some 4.51 billion birthdays. And what of her older sister, the Earth, at 81 times more massive, and 60 million years older? What a fateful taint of ignorant arrogance would I need smeared over my mind's eye to deny the possibility — nay, the probability! — that the ground beneath me meets my feet, that the sky above crafts every breath I take, that the stream babbling down the mountain sings up the sun, and of the season's snow?

We return to death. When the past and future fall away, what have we left? Were the present moment to remain indefinitely paused and timeless, what might we become? Far be it from me, who has only (medically speaking) died once (and for a paltry four or ten minutes), to assume to know anything of the death that you or anyone else might encounter. Free samples, of course, await us in the space between breaths, in the flashbacks and flashforwards ensconced within the exploded instant of a catastrophic accident, in the pits at the bottom of a lover's inky pupils, in the vast void suddenly surrounding as orgasm washes us away.

Lucretius would have us fear death as much as the eons before our birth, while Epicurus before him would have us release both fears as fruitless impediments to happiness while we live. I found myself wondering [_what it is like to be Thomas Nagel_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/fBGPBRX3JsQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA165) [considering the Epicurean perspective on death](http://dbanach.com/death.htm), which twisted into the strand where this piece unfolds before us.
