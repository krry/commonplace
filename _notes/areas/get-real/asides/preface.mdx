# Preface

This began as a eureka-fueled poem, then fantasized about becoming a manifesto, then pined away for life as a treatise. Illusions aside, it has finally wriggled out of its cocoon as a glorified FAQ. You'll still get a manifesto—and all the poetry you can swallow—but the reason I am writing this is to answer the hardest questions I have asked or come across.

There, we're done with the first one: "Why am I writing this?"

## My prime directive is "Why?"

I carry the scars of having wrestled with "Why?" for many years. It's a dirty job, a dangerous occupation. A lot of other questions grow out of "Why?": tangled webs of thorny inquisition. "Because…" isn't much kinder on the carapace.

If you too have scars, let me share the salve. I keep a boundless bowl of self-replicating [meme][meme] cream. There will be intermittent samples throughout the tour, and a full-service spa awaits you at the end.

Before we embark, I've got an Occam's razor for each of you. And we'll run through a quick hands-on primer in the Socratic method before we're in the Jeeps and into the jungle.
