# Premises for Get Real

1. [[consciousness]] is one and all.
2. [[love]] evolves Consciousness.
3. We have not observed anything else to exist or happen.

Any and every figment of [[existence]] and [[reality]] can be extrapolated or interpolated from these two premises. I intend this document to introduce and reinforce these premises and then use them to illustrate an absurdly wide, deep swath of our subjective and objective experiences of reality.

### We will touch on:

(order and format TBD)

- [[consciousness]]: [[attention]] and [[intent]]
- Desire: the theory of [[evolution]]
- [[mind]]: over and beyond [[matter]]
- [[origin]]: the Big Bang and our physical universe
- [[causality]]: [[free will]], [[determinism-vs]], and [[quantum]] uncertainty
- [[ego]]: [[fear]], scarcity, and mortality
- [[experience]]: [[sensation]] and [[perception]]
- [[consumption]]: [[food]], drugs, and [[sustainability]]
- Moksha: the [[atman]], the Brahman, and [[samsara]]
- [[love]]: the answer to any [[questions]], [[hard-questions]], [[big-hard-questions]], [[preseedling-questions]]

To shamelessly mangle Rumi, every conscious being is a drop of the ocean **and** the whole ocean in a single drop.
