## How did I get here?

If you are a neuroscientist or a medical doctor in the modern Western world, you might have an answer for us. You got here through the miracle of childbirth. A human sperm cell penetrated a human egg cell to form a zygote, which seated itself in a cozy womb where you gestated into an embryo and then into a fetus. After forty-ish weeks your baby body was pushed out of its warm, dark, gooey nest. Outside, you learned to breath air and see light and hear sounds and feel objects and slowly all of your thirty-some other exteroceptive and interoceptive senses came online and began passing sensory data about your body and your environment to your brain. Your brain was the pinnacle of evolution when it comes to central nervous systems in mammals. It started to learn to filter and interpret all these sensory signals into your perception of physical reality. You learned about your needs and how to satisfy them by opening your top hole and breathing harder. You learned about your imperfection when you opened your bottom hole and breathed harder. You soon learned that you are this body that has needs and makes waste, and that others have bodies that have needs and make waste as well.

Then it gets really fun. The questions start rolling in. "What is that? Who are you? Why am I here?" Our medically-minded scientist might then direct us back to evolution. "That is the leg of my scrubs you are tugging on. I am, of course, Dr. Oz. And you are here because evolution is the driving principle for all living things. The fittest survive. Those that can produce offspring with a high likelihood of producing offspring and so on are the fittest. You are one of the fittest."
