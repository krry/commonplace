# Answers

Too many questions, not enough answers. We're choking on information, coughing up hairballs, and are left wondering whether the deeper meaning got digested and flushed or wasn't there at all.

Here are the questions I want answers to, and then the answers I have found for them. A note to the skeptical, these are the questions I ask every morning, or whenever I wake up here.

Huh? (consciousness cross-fades)
Where am I? (doesn’t imply space, but important to note)
What happened to…? (the dire narrative of swimming in possibilities I just unwillingly slid out of)
Derp. (Whatever just happened, this feels much more real.)
Body check. (Toes wiggle, head finds up and down, shoulders roll about, pings down the vertebrae to the grundle)
When did this begin? (It didn’t.)
What caused the Big Bang? (Love. We did.)
What happens when we die? (Nothing special.)
Who are we? (Yes. We are everything. The same, and yet so intent upon being different.)
What is our purpose? (Improvement.)
Why am I here? (Randomly. You’re the only random being here. Kidding. Your purpose is the big one: to evolve with love.)
Am I conscious? (Yessish.)
What is consciousness? (Anything and everything. Some of this is a construct lovingly designed for our ongoing efficiency. All is consciousness. Some is conscious.)
