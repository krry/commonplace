# The Serious Philosophical Questions

according to Alan Watts

1. Who started it?
2. Are we going to make it?
3. Where are we going to put it?
4. Who's going to clean up?
5. Is it serious?
6. Should you or not commit suicide? Why go on?

You only go on if the game is worth the candle. Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle, a Frenchman once intoned. De ce jeu, of this game, he would have been wrong, at least judging empirically. While no player has ever established a credible claim to extra lives, few players quit before game over. Back of the napkin, we have upward of a 98% attrition rate in the United States in recent years: about 2.5 million deaths a year, about 45,000 of them suicides. Worldwide humanity has a better record than any university, though I imagine suicides are wildly underreported in every human culture. Just my imagination working here, no support for that.
