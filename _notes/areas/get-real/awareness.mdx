# Awareness

- aka:: "a whereâ€¢ness"
- lead:: What You Are, For One and All
- def:: [[CNXNS]] localized somewhere relative to somewhere else to allow [[existence]] to [[experience]] itself.
  - according to [[Steve Kaufman]]
- originally:: [[May 11th, 2018]]
- Awareness has one ability: it tends. The one becomes two. #[[Tao Te Ching]]
  - [[attention]]: To tend to, or toward, is to attend.
    - [[attention]] is [[bound]], limited, finite. We pay attention, dissipating bound energy to collect and organize information.
  - [[intent]]: To tend in, or within, is to intend.
    - ## [[intent]] is [[unbound]], unlimited, infinite. We form [[intent]] from the formless [[void]] of all possibilities.
- You are the one who has made it #NowHere and will continue to be.
- No physical [[reality]] exists that awareness does not [[experience]].
  - [[reality]] is the [[experience]] of [[awareness]].
  - Neither [[space]] nor [[mind]] exists independent of an awareness of those experiential realities
- [[awareness]] can impact its [[experience]] of [[reality]] by directing and focusing its [[attention]] inward and outward.
  - Attention focused "inward" produces a mental or spiritual experience for awareness.
  - Whereas attention focused "outward" produces awareness of a physical experience.
- The [[ðŸ§  Brain]] is not the source of awareness or [[experience]],
  - but rather is an interface between awareness and the [[World]] or physical [[reality]] that functions in part as an experiential theater, and in part as an antenna.
  - Patterns of neuronal activity occur in the [[ðŸ§  Brain]] that represent our physical and mental experiences.
  - The [[Nervous System]] (which of course includes the Brain) is a highly sensitive membrane that functions as an experiential interface between you ([[awareness]]) and everywhere else within [[CNXNS]]-[[existence]].
- ""Any differentiated area of reality can be aware if that area is capable of being impacted by other differentiated areas of reality.""

## A Witness and Maker of Changes

- Awareness comes to exist anywhere that change is experienced. It is fair to assume that any awareness shares the fundamental qualities of the consciousness of which it is a facet and/or droplet.
  - Consciousness possesses [[ignorance]] by default, moves through and due to [[love]], and is able to tend, which bifurcates into its fundamental abilities of [[attention]] and [[intent]].
  - So then conscious awareness shares in these qualities and properties.
- Can we demonstrate the presence of these properties using open-minded, skeptical, scientific inquiry? #[[Big, Hard, & Further Questions]]
  - We measure the experience of change with [[time]], so anywhere we observe time to pass may be home to verifiable awareness.
  - [[ignorance]] is evidenced by actions taken with incomplete information that lead to unintended outcomes.
  - [[love]] is present where we find [[affinity]] at [[play]] or where acts of creation or [[creativity]] occur.
  - [[attention]] is behind any shift in focus, and serves to determine what is experienced, and as such, what is real.
    - The act of attention triggers waveforms to collapse, the cloud of possibilities to coalesce, what could be to be.
  - [[intent]] sits in any volitional act, motivates every choice, and underpins any event that could have gone another way.
    - Nota Bene:: [Randomness]([[randomness]]) is an illusion we tend to accept when intent is blurred by distance, hidden by delay, or masked by complexity.

## Forms of Awareness

- The butterfly who redirects a tornado flutters with intent, however incomplete its vision of the impact might be. #ignorance
- A volcano erupts without cause or warning, or does it? #Gaia
- At the other extreme, we puzzle about the origin of life.
  - Supposing it began on Earth, that self-organizing molecules occurred in a tide pool some 3.5 billion years ago, were they aware?
  - As they formed a membrane that could hold in fluid homeostasis precise concentrations of minerals and raw materials such that amino acids spontaneously formed inside, were they aware? #Abiogenesis
  - We have observed the non-local, simultaneous development of new crystal structures and molecular assemblies.
    - For example, ice-9, a strange and until recently only theoretical molecular assembly of super cold crystalline water, was discovered in the Arctic here on Earth after decades of searching only weeks after it was spotted on a moon of Jupiter by a passing satellite. #[[Needs Support]]
    - [[Rupert Sheldrake]] posits that [[Morphic Resonance]] can explain such phenomena. Perhaps the first self-organizing membranous molecules arose through a similar non-local, resonant dynamic.
- Why too could the stars not be aware? #[[Big, Hard, & Further Questions]]
  - We surely would struggle to communicate or correspond with an awareness (or even a conscious being) of that enormity and potency. How could we relate?
  - But should we discount the possibility entirely?
- Awareness may have already taken many forms which we have been slow to recognize, but which we regularly encounter.

## From Get Real research

- We are often not aware of the unconscious, preconscious, and subconscious processes.
- Readiness potential experiments demonstrate that we are sometimes not aware of our intent until it has been expressed.
  - For example, [you can slam on the brakes before you decide to or are aware of the choice](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-science-consciousness/201702/are-some-scientists-serious-about-denying-free-will). Your intent not to crash expresses itself without your permission or knowledge.
- Knowledge or perception of a situation or fact - OED
- Consciousness localized somewhere, in "a where", allowing it to experience itself.

"So far, they havenâ€™t been successful, and even if they were, such a theory wouldnâ€™t account for everything thatâ€™s known to exist in the universe, for the universe also contains the nonphysical realities we call awareness and consciousness."

- URT, Loc. 110

"Thus, weâ€™ll demonstrate that consciousness doesnâ€™t somehow arise at some later stage in the evolution of existence, but rather that the evolution of existence into experience isnâ€™t other than the evolution of consciousness into awareness and that experiential reality itself is whatâ€™s created at a certain stage in the evolution of consciousness-existence."
