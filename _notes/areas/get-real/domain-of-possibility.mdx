# Domain of Possibility

Where does the domain of possibility reside?

Could it be NPMR (Non-Physical Material Reality) in Campbell's model?

Could this be where the mind resides for dualists like David Chalmers and Freeman Dyson?

What powers it?

Could dark energy and dark matter represent or relate to the domain of possibility?

If all the possible events that could be actualized in our manifest reality once existed in the domain of possibilities, this domain would hold a great deal more information than our universe.

String theory and M-theory lead us to concoct a divergent perspective of reality as a multiverse of unobservable, uncountable other universes. Perhaps we need not stress and strain to concern ourselves with universes we define as unobservable, when we can observe in every moment the impact of the unbounded domain of possibilities, especially seeing as our minds, as drops of pure consciousness might be residents/citizens/inhabitants/children of that very domain.
