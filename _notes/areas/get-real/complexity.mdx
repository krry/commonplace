# Complexity science
- Definition
	- "Complexity science investigates how relationships between the small parts of some entity give rise to the collective behavior of large-scale systems, and how these emergent global systems interact and form relationships with lower levels of organization and with the surrounding environment." - [via Paul L. Nunez, Ph.D. in Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-science-consciousness/201701/the-new-science-consciousness)
- Larger cultural systems influence each other, and have a top-down influence on social networks and individuals, which then act bottom-up on the larger scale systems forming cyclical causality.

## Emergence
- Definition
	- "Emergence refers to novel large-scale features that arise through the actions of smaller entities that do not possess such features in isolation." [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-science-consciousness/201702/is-the-brain-more-the-sum-its-parts)
- Examples:
	- "Nations, wars, and economic conditions emerge from the collective interactions of individual citizens."
	- "The molecules necessary for life have emergent properties (like genetic information storage) that may be impossible to anticipate from the fundamental physics of the atomic building blocks."
	- "Tornadoes and other weather systems emerge from simpler interactions of small air masses, and so forth."
	- "[M]inds are believed by most scientists to emerge from the massive interaction of nerve cells, but how is this possible?"

## Cross-scale Influences
- Complexity science acknowledges that a large scale system influences its components, subsystems, and individual participants, while those smaller entities lead to the emergence of new properties in the large scale system.
- Cross-scale influence can be modeled as cyclic causality.

## The Multi-scale Conjecture
Consciousness is “encoded” in (or “equals”) dynamic patterns occurring at multiple scales, e.g., the single neuron scale, patterns in millions of neurons (as measured by EEG), and intermediate scales. Furthermore, perhaps consciousness is intimately associated with cross scale interactions, both bottom-up and top-down.

## Brain-Mind Correlation
- bigger brains tend to have more neurons in them
- animals with larger brains tend to be more intelligent
	- Dolphins, whales, humans, apes
- the cerebral cortex tends to have a uniform thickness among animals
- the surface area of the cortex—the amount of brain membrane—tends to correlate with intelligence
- humans have the highest brain to body weight ratio
	- some animals and organisms may have collective minds among many brains
