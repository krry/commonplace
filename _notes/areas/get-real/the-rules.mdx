# The Rules of the Game

## You are (I am) [[awareness]].

- "Awareness has one ability: it tends. The one becomes two. #[[tao-te-ching]]"
- You can pay [[attention]].
  - You [[experience]] [[reality]] as you direct your [[attention]].
    - You can experience yourself in relation to reality as you direct your attention inward.
    - You can experience reality in relation to yourself as you direct your attention outward.
- You can set [[intent]].
  - You impact [[reality]] through actions that manifest your [[intent]].
  - You will eventually [[experience]] the impact of your intent. #karma

## You have a [[body]].

- A [[body]] is made of [[matter]] and runs on [[energy]].
  - You can only move your [[body]]
    you can only make your choices. #[[free-will]]
  - Your body can move other bodies, and your choices can make others' choices.
  - [[time]] slows down and [[mass]] builds for [[matter]] as it accelerates. #relativity
  - Your [[body]] will grow and hurt and heal and eventually disintegrate and become [[food]]. #pain #pleasure #death #[[law-of-return]]

## [[affinity]] governs [[existence]].

- Like attracts like into union.
- Difference repels when close, attracts when far.
- The more connected you become, the better you will feel. this is [[emotion]] at work, moving us together back to [[unity]]
- Union, community, epiphany, reuniting, birth, marriage, Shared joy/[[mudita]] and mutual bliss/[[orgasm]] bring us [[pleasure]], which along with fear of [[pain]], fuels our [[drive]].
- The more separated we end up [[feeling]], the worse you will become.
- Division, isolation, discombobulation, dismemberment, divorce, and [[death]] are painful, separating experiences you will want to avoid. #pain
- [[love]] is the answer.
