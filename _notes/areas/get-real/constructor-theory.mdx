# Constructor Theory

Reductionism begins with a concept of the world that is grander than we can imagine, attempts to reduce it into components we ***can*** understand, then hopes to rearchitect and explain the grand, unimaginable world using only these components. As a prime example, take the Standard Model of particle physics, which attempts to describe all the phenomena we observe in the physical world as the behavior of twelve particles subject to four forces. Notably it does not account for the most familiar of the four forces, gravity. This model, while it is our most reliable predictor of physical phenomena thus far, at best can explain the behavior of only 5% of the total mass-energy in the observable universe. The remaining 95% has been labeled invisible, with 68% of it referred to as dark energy, and the other 27% as dark matter. While it is healthy to acknowledge our innate ignorance, Reductionism does not appear to be a very fruitful worldview if its best explanation, the Standard Model, can account for only less than 5% of what we observe.

Perhaps what we need is not a better explanation, but a different mode of explanation. Enter Constructor Theory. David Deutsch, Chiara Marletto, and Simon Benjamin are constructing, if you'll pardon the pun, this well-needed alternative to reductionism, which seeks to draw what were once softer, approximated sciences into the realm of physics, explaining the phenomena of life, information, thermodynamics, probability, and quanta under one roof.

A constructor is an entity that can carry out a given task (a transformation or change in the state of being) repeatedly while remaining unchanged itself.

I am a constructor of experience.
