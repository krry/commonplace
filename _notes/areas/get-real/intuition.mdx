# Intuition

- Datetime:: [[April 22nd, 2018]]
- Our normal connection to the domain of possibilities or the non-physical part of our being is [[intuition]].
  - The results of queries into actualized past reality state vectors and possible future reality state vectors. Equivalent with [[memory]] from this perspective. More on [[actualization]].
  - The domain of possibilities holds all the answers we might seek instantaneously accessible to any consciousness that focuses its intent on particular questions. Intuition is the result of such a query.
- Much of our imaginative credibility draws on unactualized part and future state vectors for content and narrative. How it could have been feels quite real when told as a supposedly fictional narrative.
