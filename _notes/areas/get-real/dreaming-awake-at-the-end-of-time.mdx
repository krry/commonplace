[His summation](https://youtu.be/KboPUQ0xCDs?t=2816)

Having lost the unity of consciousness, we are in a hypnotic state of waking sleep, says [George Gurdjieff](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/George_Gurdjieff).

Love is the cosmic giggle, the existential trump card.

The world is made of language.
Information is primary.
Human hardware has reached a local plateau.
We continue to upgrade the operating system.

Today we dream in casuistry.
Conspiracy theories are comforting epistemological cartoons.
The more frightening truth is that no one is in control.

So we, in our scattered dream,
balkanize epistemology, and branch Truth:
- Kabbalah
- Econometrics
- Quantum mechanics
- Cosmology
- Angel Armies
- Theology
- Buddhism
- Chaos theory
- Neuroscience

We have a responsibility to dream elegantly, and an obligation to awaken subtly.

Neotony, the retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood. We look like fetal apes. Culture, the collective network operating system, is a neotonizing force. We agree upon silly, absurd answers to important questions.

The final call is aesthetic, elegance of thought is paramount.

Plato encourages the pursuit of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, of which the Beautiful is easiest to discern, identify, and agree upon.

That the universe came from nothing for no reason is the limit case for credulity. Whereas McKenna would define God as the novelty-generating process driving the increase of complexity in the universe. Habit, in contrast to novelty is entropic.
