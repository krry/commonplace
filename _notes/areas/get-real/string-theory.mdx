# String TheoryString Theory

Currently experts in string theory estimate that it offers us 10^500 possible solutions, each of which is plausible as the correct solution, as a description of the universe we inhabit. This number of solutions far surpasses the number of particles in the universe and is decidedly prohibitive to iterating through them in search for the proper solution.
