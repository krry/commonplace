# Whatever the Question…

This began with one question. "Why?" Thirtysome years ago in this very room—now nicknamed the Happy Room, back then it was "my room"—in the humble beige ranch-style house at the top of the circle at the top of the hill on Great Day Lane I began to ask myself "Why?".

Bedtime would come, and—as is tradition for those fortunate enough to have their own childhood bedrooms—I would be relegated to solitude until morning. I craved more stimuli, more experiences, more love, but the world I had been born into had rules and structure. I wriggled with curiosity. I feared nothing. I wanted knowledge!

Left alone in a quiet, dark room, I strategized an escape. Rather than fleeing out of doors, I smuggled a flashlight into my nocturnal sanctuary. With this beacon of insight, I sought knowledge and understanding in the virtual realities constructed in books. When I was scolded for reading past my sacred bedtime, when I was told to just shut my eyes and go to sleep or I would be too tired to get up for school, when I acquiesced to their parental demands, I was left alone in the silent dark with my question echoing. "Why?"

"Why do I have to go to school?" I would ask.

When I was around grownups and kids during the day, I would grasp the opportunity to test my questions, so I could repeat back the best answers I had received and continue the great nightly inquiry.

"So you can learn about math and science and history and language and art."

"Why do I want to learn about those things?"

"So you can choose a job you will love. You can choose any job you want if you learn enough about how to do it."

"Why do I want a job?"

"Because everyone has to work so we can all have food and water and shelter and be happy."

"Why do I want to be happy?"

"Because… um, being happy makes like more enjoyable…?"

"Are you happy?"

"Some of the time."

"Do you love your job?"

"Not really."

"Did you do good in school?"

"Well. Yes, I did very *well* in school."

"Why aren't you happy if you did well in school? Did you not get a job you love?"

"I don't know. I used to love my job. I'm not really doing what I went to school for."

"Why do I have to go to school again?"

"So you can learn about how everything works and someday be the best *you* you can be."

"Why do I want to be the best *me* I can be?"

"Why would you not want to be the best *you*?"

(And here I thought I was asking the questions here. It's kinda weird when your internal dialogue flips the script on you.)

"Well, being the *me* I am now is the easiest. I can just lie here and be the same *me*."

"You're right. Go ahead and give that a try. Report back to me when you  are done with your experiment."

An interminable amount of time passes. The crushing boredom of stagnation and inertia weighs upon me.

"I want to get better!"

"Yes, I know you do. We all do, that's why we are here."

"But why? Why do I want to get better?"

"No one knows. But it's the meaning of life, the *raison d'être*, the *joie de vivre*."

"But why?"

"I don't know. But keep asking."

Sometimes the Great Nightly Inquiry would go in a darker direction. 

"Why should I be good? Why do I want to get better?"

Some of the Catholics that ran my school, my church, and my family thought they had a good answer worth sharing.

"So you can go to heaven and be with God and everyone you love forever."

"Okay, that sounds nice. How long is forever?"

"Forever is never ending."

"Never ending?"

"Yeah it has no end. It just goes on."

"So what if you get tired of heaven?"

"You don't."

"Has anyone ever been to heaven?"

"Sure, lots of people. The saints are all in heaven. Your great-grandparents are there waiting to meet you someday a long time from now."

"Can we ask them what it's like?"

"Yes, you can pray about it. You can pray about anything you want and listen for God's answers."

"Does God ever tell us what heaven is like?"

"You'll have to find out for yourself."

"Can we try it out first, so we know we want to go there?"

"No, you have to wait until you die. You have to live a good life and pray for God's mercy. But even that is not enough. Only by the Divine Will of God the Father who sacrificed his only Son to redeem us for our sins can we be granted Everlasting Salvation."

"That's a pretty long bet. I don't think I like those odds."

With these answers in my quiver I kept asking "Why?"—only less and less often. I reached dead end after dead end, refining the set of big questions while accumulating few satisfactory answers.
