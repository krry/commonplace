- Only Everything #Tao
    - A self-generating fractal of nested, looping scales of complexity
        - Every piece of Œ is a fraction and a fractal, is fractional.
        - So any ability or quality of a fractional of Œ is relative to the other fractionals — its value is relative.
        - What made Œ, most logically, would have to be a fractionally symmetrical consciousness that is both higher and lower degree, infinitely so.
    - Ouroboros
        - An infinity loop with a fractional twist that grows with love both inward and out.
        - A Møebius strip with a fractal twist
    - A drop of the ocean and the whole ocean in a single drop
    - Infinitesimally Divisible and yet only one thing: no-thing
- Each sliver of consciousness shares its attributes and abilities:
    - Ignorance
        - We tend to love as we yen to know.
    - Tending
        - Attention and Intention, Inward and Outward
        - With which we resolve ignorace
    - Evolution
        - The Law of Attraction
            - We improve, we get better at what we do.
            - We attract what we expect.
    - Prime Directive
        - Get better at resolving ignorance
            - Love is the most effective strategy
                - [[Love is the Answer]]
