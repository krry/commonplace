## [Joint Attention](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Joint_attention)

Infants learn to follow the eye-gazing or pointing of others by seven to nine months old. They innately understand attention before almost anything else.

## Defined

- Notice taken of someone or something - OED
- From the Latin _attendere_ meaning "to stretch to".

As an awareness, I can attend or tend to. My attention breeds awareness: it notices, it observes, it listens, it cares, it organizes, it guides. I can direct my attention inward and outward. My attention seeks an object. When I am the object of my attention, I notice that I am the subject of my attention. I am looking at the eyes in the mirror, but I am not the eyes themselves, and I am not the mirror, nor the image I see in it.

### Attention: Input

I can direct my attention inward or outward, but attention still needs a target. Whether pointed inward or outward, attention gathers data which allow us to resolve our ignorance and assess changes in our quality. Attention is the input of consciousness’ feedback loop.

Inward attention observes, and evaluates the quality of, the self. "I am feeling serene and joyful as I write this to you." My mind looks inward as I attend my emotional state. We build knowledge of self by observing ourselves from various perspectives and by noticing ourselves in various states, conditions, and sets of circumstances.

Outward attention evaluates the quality of others. "These cookies are still warm from the oven." Having noticed these cookies and their gooey warmth, I attend inward to my body's need for cookies, factoring in their supple, buttery, doughy salacity, and then attend further inward to my spirit-rending, plane-quaking desire for these cookies, a desire that reigns supreme disregardful of time and/or space for these cookies, these sinister oven-melted goops of crumbled scree that once rat-a-tatted in the mortal gale that sweeps under the towering, twinkling precipice of eternal damnation, and then I set my intention to devour them, or to find a proper mouth for these cookies, and to never attempt to use cookies as a "for instance" again.

Others that can attend themselves and others—that are able to direct their attention inward and outward, observe themselves and others from various perspectives, and notice themselves and others in various states, conditions, and sets of circumstances—they are conscious **beings**. Others that cannot attend themselves or others around them are non-conscious **objects**, whereas others who possess attention but do not use it are still conscious.

    - at the bottom of which sits the [[Well of Being]]
    - that draws upon the [[source]]
- outward
  - attention directed outward peers from:
    - the [[void]] of the [[source]]
    - the Atman unseen
