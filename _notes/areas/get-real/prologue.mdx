# Prologue

Well, here we are. I am in an airport in Texas in the middle of the night. A few other souls are here polishing the floors. Where do you find yourself? At a space-time somewhere on planet Earth, on land or at sea, in the day or at night, indoors or outdoors, in summer, fall, spring, or winter, or during the dry or wet season. At the end of the day, do you lay awake like me asking "Why?"

I remember when the questions started to bubble up in my child mind.
Why here? Why now? How did I get here? Who or what made me? Why am I aware? Are other people aware like me? What do I deserve? What should I do with my life?

Asking why has led me down many paths, paths paved in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, machine learning, neural nets, artificial intelligence, mathematics, linguistics, evolutionary biology, cosmology, quantum electrodynamics/mechanics/physics, metaphysics. I see the silhouettes of answer berries in the brambles along these paths, but when I reach out to pluck one of these tasty morsels I end up with more questions in my grasp instead. Neuroscientists can't figure out where the memory resides in the brain, where thoughts come from, or what triggers consciousness. Cognitive psychologists counsel us to observe our thought patterns and the feelings and emotions that accompany them, and learn to be mindful of our internal monologue. Linguists and semanticists find meaning in symbols, but cannot explain how or why that meaning arises. Computer scientists model our brains and our minds with transistors and algorithms, but can only produce artificial intelligence, not artificial consciousness. Evolutionists theorize that our minds could have evolved as survival mechanisms, that our brains have grown to support better pattern recognition, memory, sensory processing, and problem solving. Quantum theory breaks this material reality into tiny, elusive bits of probability, deconstructing and reconstructing our observable universe out of randomness and uncertainty. Information theory views all matter and energy as bits of information, built of binary containers of potential meaning.

Ask a scientist where our minds come from. Some will attempt to demonstrate that every thought, feeling, and intention results from feedback loops of electrical signals that evolves as brains ride around the planet in bodies interacting with others.

You are a single drop in an ocean of consciousness and the whole ocean in a single drop.
