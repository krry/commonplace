# Judgment

Only by first placing ourselves apart can we take positions of authority or subjugation. Otherwise we remain connected and the illusion of hierarchy cannot be maintained. If we are separate though, we can stand over or under others.

From above, we can assign blame or praise. Standing below, we can be subjected to blame or praise. They go together, like hot and cold or yang and yin. Praise requires the same fiction of authority as blame; the same voice that says "Great job!" also tells you "It's all your fault!"

We can ask whether blame serves us. What is the purpose of blame? How does it shake out?
