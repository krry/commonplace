# Panpsychism

Consciousness/mind/soul/psyche is a universal and primordial feature of all things. We are minds in a world of mind.

Perhaps Campbell's Big TOE fits into this school of philosophy.

Chalmers states that consciousness must be described using nonphysical means. A concept of mind is necessary to describe our experience of reality in the way that mass and time are necessary to describe the behavior of nature.
