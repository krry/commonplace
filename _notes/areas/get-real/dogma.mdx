# Dogma and Belief

Belief is a bandaid for ignorance. It patches the hole without filling it or healing it.

When you approach your innate ignorance alone, as an isolated, separate individual, fear is likely to arise. If you are impermanent, the unknown could harm you, could threaten your existence. To keep yourself safe, you can try to resolve your ignorance, to know the unknown. If that doesn’t work, you will need a backup plan. That’s where belief comes in handy.

A belief doesn’t require knowledge or understanding. If ignorance is a hole in the wall you build around yourself to protect you from threats to your existence, belief is a roll of leftover wallpaper you can use to cover the hole. It stand to reason, sticks out like a sore thumb when you don’t do the whole wall with the same paper, and you’ll find yourself defending it more than it defends you. A belief is an unprovable fiction that masks the problem without repairing it.

Beliefs collected together and shared form dogma. Dogma repeated together forms religion.

[The etymology of religion's Latin root *religio*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3087765) is quite intricately contested. But the most likely origin of this word is the Latin *relegere* meaning "to go through or over again in reading, speech, or thought". The alternative preferred by religious commentators throughout the centuries after Cicero has been *religare* meaning "to bind again". Wouldn't that be convenient, as if the very definition of the thing you keep doing and want other people to keep doing was to keep doing the thing? I think it's a little more literal and less convenient than that.
