# Feedback Loops Of The Mind And In Time

- Modeled while at the Carter Compound
- [[attention]] and [[intent]] and [[habits]] inform a choice
- [[choice]] has an [[outcome]] and an [[impact]] on the [[situation]]
- the [[situation]] is logged in [[memory]] and [noticed]([[noticing]]) with [[attention]]
- [[habits]] form as [[attention]] is directed in repetitive patterns without a shift in [[intent]]

- v2 modeled two days later as a temporal loop
  - Memory and habits feed our attention and intent
    - which inspire a choice
    - which has an outcome
      - changing the situation
      - to which we can attend
        - and perhaps adjust our intent
          - but often memory and habits resume control
          - until we are confronted with the next choice
