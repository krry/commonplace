- [[CNXNS]] can travel within time, and between alternate reality state vectors within a reality plane on which it is aware.
- [[CNXNS]] can also leap between realities, but no need for its body to leap with it.
- According to [[Tom Campbell]], teleporting one's body within a physical/virtual reality is possible but subject to the psi Æ± uncertainty principle.
