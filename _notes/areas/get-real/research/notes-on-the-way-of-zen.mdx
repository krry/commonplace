# The Way of Zen - Thoughts while reading

by Alan Watts

## Subjectivity

The common condition of every awareness is the experience of reality from a uniquely subjective perspective. Each of us is because we have these unique subjective perspectives and vice versa. It is our raison d'etre.

Contrarily, as William James put it, "we are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep." Because we each represent a bud at the tip of a branch stemming from many larger branches to limbs off the trunk of a single father tree rooted in mother earth, intermingling, interacting, and interpenetrating a multitude of other buds, we innately feel our connectedness and crave to convert or translate our unique subjective perspectives into something shared, something agreeable. So we construct abstractions to describe our subjective experiences: language, art, maths.

"You do not know where your decisions come from, they pop up like hiccoughs."

## Buddhism

*Mahayana* means great vehicle
It refers to the earlier Pali Canon as *hinayana*, little vehicle.
*Upaya* are methods of attainment of liberation.
*Nirvana* or *moksha* are the liberation from self, attachment, suffering, frustration (all *dukkha*).
Medieval Indian *tantra* involves the repetition of *mantra* (spiritual words and formulae called *dharani* and yoga directed toward sexual intercourse with a *shakti* or spiritual wife.

Buddha likely intended his "*upaya*, a skillful means of enabling one to realize, concretely and vividly, the absurd vicious circle of desiring not to desire, or of trying to get rid of selfishness by oneself."

*Bhakti* is the devotion a Bodhisattva may focus upon having attained enlightenment and refused nirvana to instead remain and share his insight with others.
