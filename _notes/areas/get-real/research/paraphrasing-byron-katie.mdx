# Paraphrasing Byron Katie and Stephen Mitchell on the Diamond Sutra and The Work

The Diamond Sutra and the great spiritual texts describe the **what**. The Work is the **how**.

### Echoes of *A Mind at Home with Itself*

## On suffering

Stressful thoughts yield anger, sadness, resentment. They get the hurt wheel spinning: fear => guilt => blame => spite => fearu Every emotion that arises has a right to life, and to be understood.

We cannot know that babies who are crying are suffering.

Fear is born only to words believed by prior words believed and so on.

# The mind's only way out is in.

We're not guilty of anything, but we suffer as though we are.

## On projection

Everything happens for you, not to you.

I do unto others as I do unto myself, because I realize that others are myself. The Golden Rule is fact, not a command.

People like or dislike their stories of you. You're their projection, just as they are yours.

If you take his criticism personally, you're the one who hurts you. Of course, his story of you might be more accurate than yours, so listen up. His praise doesn't do you any favors, unless as an opportunity for mutual appreciation and gratitude.

Whatever you get is what you need. (See also, LL Hay's theory of choosing our parents for the lesson we need to learn.)

## On property

I give anything someone desires or requests. Nothing belongs to me alone. What I give away isn't mine. In fact, I own nothing, I have nothing, I am nothing.

I am not generous. I am generosity. Or rather, as the Buddha would say, I am only called 'generosity'.

Do you tell yourself the story that you need more than you already have? All beings are one and yet no one, and so equal, equanimous.

I accept with purposeless gratitude what anyone gives me for their own sake. Everything belongs to me as much as to anyone; there is no self or other for anything to belong to.

Without a story, we are pure generosity, pure vanity (as in "emptiness"), pure selfish compassion for the one and only anatman (not-self).

When I gave away possessing, I gained everything. Now we share. Abundance isn't about yesterday or tomorrow. When striving falls away and generosity remains, we cannot want for anything.

"We all get what we need, exactly when we need it."

## On comparison

Comparison keeps us from the awareness of what is. Everyone has the perfect body.

Bodies don't crave, don't want, don't know, don't care, don't love, don't hate, don't get hungry or thirsty. The body reflects what the mind attaches to. Body follows mind; it doesn't have a choice. So do not try to heal your body. Heal your mind. Meet your stressful thoughts with understanding.

No one is wiser than anyone else. The only difference is that some of us believe what we think, and some of us have learned to question the thoughts that separate us from our inborn wisdom.

## On empathy

Suffering comes from an imagined past or future, from an identified mind remembering or anticipating what isn't happening in reality. Our job isn't to wake the dreamer, but to understand, to be love, and to be present.

Believing horrors shouldn't happen, when they do happen, brings you suffering. But the end of suffering begins in you, dropping the "should"s, accepting and loving what is.

## On solitude

Loneliness comes from an honest place. No one has ever met anyone.

"Develop a mind that abides nowhere."
— the Diamond-Cutter Transcendent Wisdom Scripture, or *Vajracchedikā Prajnāpāramitā Sūtra*, c. 350 C.E.

It's only ever yourself you're dealing with.

## On mortality

Everyone knows how to die. We perfect it every night, when trade this realm of the senses for the void of oblivious chaos as we sleep.

Ain't no life or death, just throbbing gratitude, just interweaving streams of vanishing dreams with no dreamer.

Nothing is born but a thought believed, and nothing dies but a thought once realized.

"Death will never happen."

"[W]hen there is no escape, when no one is coming to save you, beliefs drop away. You just don't bother. ... There's no longer anything left to lose. In that sweet peace, there's only you. You're it."

"How can I know that an environmental catastrophe will happen or, if it does happen, that it will be a bad thing for the planet? Once you understand this, and begin to live in reality, not in your thoughts about reality, life becomes fearless, loving, and filled with gratitude, what the nonexistent future may bring. ... I go about my business as if there were no life and death (and there isn't)."

## On maths

Everything in the universe is made of numbers of different colors, sounds, shapes, sizes, quantities, speeds, light. These numbers add up to zero, but a zero is actually a one imagining a zero, which is what is prior to nothing: something imagining nothing becoming everything.

## On levity

Everything is play. The universe is always friendly. People recognize innocence, cradle innocents.

"Generosity is what's left of you after you realize that there's no such thing as a self."

"Happiness is the natural state [when we know] that there is nothing to know, and that we already have everything we need, right here now." — BK

Wanting what you have is the only way you can ever be happy. Gratitude, gratitude, gratitude.

## On reality

The real world is the world before/beyond names.

The world of illusion is a reflection of mind, believed into being. When you believe a thought that argues with reality, you're confused. Confusion is the only suffering in this world. It doesn't need saving. Suffering is optional if we question our thoughts.

We can save the real world by seeing it, and by losing ourself, everyone, and everything we thought we knew through honest, open inquiry.

## On inquiry

You can't have anything. You can't have any truth. Inquiry takes that all away.

If an apparent truth has an opposite, it can't be valid. E.g., "there is no God" or "God is Love".

To free yourself from suffering, and awaken to effortless ecstasy, to a life full of deep, silent laughter, meet your mind—your thoughts—with understanding through inquiry.

The more the mind understands, the less it knows.

Clarity won't permit a single belief. Self is a concept.

There are no new stressful thoughts—they're all recycled.

If a thought hurts, question it. To end suffering, end every thought with a question mark.

## On mating

Check on your mate. If distressed, say: "I'm sorry I did this to you. It's all my fault. What can I do to make it right?" Checkmate.

It takes only one person to have a happy marriage. The other can be a miserable, worthless, insufferable wastoid (my words).

No one you love can leave you, so you can love that they love who they love. Love will meet itself in any form. Love complies.

## On memory

We often find ourself presented (brought to the present moment) with memories as stories of the past. We can accept or reject these like any other stories.

## On identity

The first story is "I". A questioning mind can undo even this  first story.

I am just an internal yes, loving what is, being thought, focusing solely on what is happening.

"What I want is what is."

We all hunger to serve what serves.

All names are lies. They assume that there are separate beings.

There are no thoughts and you're not the one thinking them.

I am movement, as we all are when we believe our thoughts.

Tathagata
- "the one who has thus come (or gone)"
- "the one who has arrived at the truth, just as it is"
- "the one who appears just as he is"

## On Autonomy

"Everything comes and goes in its own time. You have no control. You never had any control, and you never will. You only tell the story of what you think is happening. Do you think you cause movement? You don't. It just happens but you tell the story of how you had something to do with it. ... The only thing you can play with is the story. That's the only game in town."

## On education

"The only thing worth learning is to unlearn. The way to do this is to question everything you think you know."

There are no students, only friends. The teacher has nothing to teach, knows nothing and knows it.

Criticism can aim our arrows of inquiry.

Telling without consent is not well received. Wait to be asked, then teach nothing.

## On enlightenment

"The mind's only way out is in."

"Enlightenment is as close to you as your own most troubling thought."

"Thus, in reality there is no self to attain enlightenment and no sentient beings to be liberated."
— Diamond Sutra

"It's not that I'm not joyful. It's as though I've grasped a pearl in a pile of shit."
— Tung-shan to his teacher as his third eye opened

"Enlightenment is the realization that enlightenment doesn't exist."
— Huang-po, Zen master

"Enlightenment is the enjoyment of endarkenment."
— Sam Keen, *The Passionate Life: Stages of Loving*

## On love

"Mind originates in love and ultimately returns to its source. Love is mind's homing device, and until mind returns, it has no rest." Returning to love, mind and all its thoughts and identities dissolve into the void.

Only love has the power to heal.

Wedding vow: "I promise to love you until I don't."

"Where change is possible, I help make it happen. That willingness is built into me. It's built into you. It's called love."

"It takes an open mind to question your certainties. It takes a mind that is fearless in its journey inward, a mind willing to go to places it has never been before. It's a journey into what is true. And everything dissolves into the truth. Nothing survives it. It is love itself, and there is nothing that it isn't. It's the mind finally resting in itself, at home with itself. It's the end of contradiction, war, unkindness—the end of identity as body, the end of the separate self. The enlightened mind understands that nothing exists but its own joyous nature."
— Byron Katie, *A Mind at Home*, p. 196

## The Worksheet

1. In this situation, who angers, confuses, saddens, or disappoints you, and why?
2. In this situation, how do you want them to change? What do you want them to do?
3. In this situation, what advice would you offer them?
4. In order for you to be happy in this situation, what do you need them to think, say, feel, or do?
5. What do you think of them in this situation? Make a list. Be petty and judgmental.
6. What is it about this situation that you don't ever want to experience again?

# The Work

## Method

State a belief, then ask:
1. Is it true? (y/n)
2. Can you absolutely know that it's true? (y/n)
3. How do you react, what happens, when you belief that thought? (describe suffering)
4. Who would you be without the thought? (become love)

When you do the Work, you see who are by seeing who you think others are. The small bit you haven't forgiven, that you still resent someone for, is the very place where you're stuck in all your relationships.

Do any obsessions or addictions begin to appear when you believe the thought in question 3?

### Turnarounds

Then turn the belief around on yourself, on the other, and on itself.

E.g.,
"I find this dog disgusting."

1. Yes.
2. No.
3. Reviled, tense, uncomfortable.
4. Kinder to the dog. A dog washer.

TOs:
- "I find myself disgusting."
- "This dog finds me disgusting."
- "I do not find this dog disgusting."
