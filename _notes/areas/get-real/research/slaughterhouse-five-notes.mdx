# slaughterhouse five notes

"As an Earthling I had to believe whatever clocks said, and calendars."

It begins like this: "Listen, Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time."

He has seen his own birth and death many times, he says, and pays random visits to all the events in between, he says.

Billy is spastic in time, has no control over where he is going next and the trips aren't necessarily fun.

And it ends like this: "Poo-tee-*weet*!"

On Tralfamadorians:

> The creatures were friendly and could see in four dimensions. They pitied Earthlings for being able to see in only three. They had many wonderful things to teach Earthlings especially about time.

> All moments past present and future always have existed, always will exist.

> It is just an illusion here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string.

> I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people which is: "So it goes."

What a Tralfamadorian exercise it was, to eat and die at the same time.

This was when Billy first came unstuck in time. His attention began to swing grandly through the full arc of his life, passing into death, which was violet light. There wasn't anybody else there, or any thing. There was just violet light and a hum. And then Billy swung into life again, going backwards until he was in pre-birth, which was red light and bubbling sounds. And then he swung into life again and stopped.
