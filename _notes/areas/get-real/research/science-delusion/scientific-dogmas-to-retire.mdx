# Ten Scientific Dogmas to Retire
from *The Science Delusion* by Rupert Sheldrake

1. Nature is mechanical.  
Living and non-living thing are machines, organisms are "lumbering robots" or "survival machines" as Dawkins would say.
2. Matter is unconscious.  
Descartes posited that only God, angels, and humans are supposed to have spirits/souls/consciousness. Cartesian duality was later reduced to materialism (matter is the only reality) by the anti-religious polemics of atheistic intellectuals. Our modern sense of medicine, factory farming, and bioethics stick to this dogma which would say that everything (stars, galaxies, planets, plants, animals, rocks) in nature is unconscious except the human mind.
3. The laws of nature are fixed.
4. The total amount of matter and energy in the universe remains the same.
5. Nature is purposeless.  
Evolution has no purpose or direction. The entire universe is blindly going nowhere.  
"Give us one free miracle, and we'll explain the rest." - Terence McKenna, a friend of Sheldrake's, describing scientists.
6. Biological inheritance is material.
Most scientists still believe that all biological functions and structures are manifested by our genes, epigenetic modifications to our genes, or cytoplasmic inheritance. But structures and functions can proliferate in nature without genes, epigenetics, or cytoplasm through morphic resonance.
7. Memories are stored materially inside your brains.  
We guess that they are stored in the form of phosphorylated proteins or modified nerve endings. Morphic resonance may explain how memory persists as well.
8. Your mind is nothing but the activity of your brain.
9. Psychic phenomena like telepathy are illusory.
10. Mechanistic medicine is the only kind that works.

From [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-einstein-revealed-the-universe-s-strange-nonlocality/), objects and entities have locality in spacetime.

Are impermanence, suffering, and non-self valuable to the quality of consciousness?
