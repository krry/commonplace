# Mass

- Might it be that:: a supernova is the birth of a [[moon]], not the death of a star?
- #[[Might it be that]] mass and consciousness ([[CNXNS]]) closely or even directly correlate?
- [[Might it be that]] the [[moon]] feeds upon the souls of those who die on Earth? Might our wills be subsumed to that of the Earth serving us the Moon, and the Moon greedily devouring us?
