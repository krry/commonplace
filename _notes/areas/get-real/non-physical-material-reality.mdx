title: Non Physical Material Reality
---
# Non Physical Material Reality- put forward in [[Big TOE]] by [[Tom Campbell]]
- Clarity from a Cloud
- A [[domain of possibility]] accessible to the awareness unified and mindless (the AUM)
- The [[source]] of [[creativity]]
- the store of [[memory]]
- the realm of dreams, visions of alternate realities, and possible futures
- to be explored as a conscious observer and chooser able to focus/direct attention and intent inward and outward, but not, of course, as a body, or with a body unless that body is non-physical
- Recalled memories, dreams, visions, imagination all tend to provide the same format of experience â€” a construct of reality viewed by the [[mind]]'s eye
