# Ignorance

## Ignorance and the Prime Yen

Consciousness, at its root, at its core, is ignorant. It was ignorant before there was time, and it is ignorant now.

I am here in a world of constant change and impermanence. I want to know why, and how. That is my fundamental motivation. I want to know the Truth, to resolve my ignorance. That's what got me into this mess here, trying to model the intricacies of consciousness with you.

[[actualization]] resolves ignorance.

- Tagline:: **Ignoramus ergo sumus.**
  - We do not know, thus we are.
- [[Contrary to popular belief]]
  - Ignorance is not bliss, but it does allow for the possibility of bliss as we resolve it, as we evolve.
- Ignorance is:
  - the original condition of [[CNXNS]]
  - a vacuum of understanding that we naturally abhor and want to fill with knowledge or belief.
  - a gift in that it is the core/basic/fundamental motivation of CNXNS and conscious beings to resolve ignorance into understanding
