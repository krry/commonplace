The revolution is here

For some it may be a matter of time. Each of us decides when to experience this gentle revolution of love and connection. The Japanese call this sudden awakening *satori*.

My awakening occurred around 4 a.m. on 4 March 2018 as I listened to Tom Campbell explain his Big TOE [here](https://youtu.be/BjDQzCq6FdM). Love is the answer, he said, and the simulation is real. And finally the message sank in. It's not serious. It's a grand game. And love is how we win. And all we win is love.

Consciousness is everything.
We conscious beings share consciousness, so we innately share everything, and possess the qualities and abilities of consciousness. We default to ignorance. We have awareness of self. We have attention to direct and intent to set.

We use these qualities and abilities to play the game. Our awareness of self and our ignorance form our strategies. Our attention and intent execute those strategies and inform our awareness and ignorance.

Property is a strategy rooted in delusion. There are no objects to own. Control, and its cousins power and privacy, are rooted in the same delusion. There is no other to conceal ourself from, to command, or to dominate. These may be entertaining pursuits, but they are not winning strategies.

Contrary to popular belief in much of the West, matter is not the base of reality.
There are no others, only reflections of self.
Time is cyclic not linear, and an illusion.
I live here and now. I have never been elsewhere or elsewhen.
Fear of ignorance and fear of not-being lead us to weave our egos of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves set outside of now, and thus outside of reality.

Do we count those who self-immolate among them? I will leave the accounting to you. You may soon find that accounting and the other accoutrements of the linear time fallacy lose their appeal. We'll address progress and success. We'll sum up money. Time will fall away. Hope will be lost, but we will find what hope cannot offer you.
