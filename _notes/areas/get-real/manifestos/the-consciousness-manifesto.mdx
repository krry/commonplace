# The Consciousness Manifesto

You are conscious. I am conscious. We share Consciousness.

Consciousness is everything, the only thing, and not a thing.

We share everything.

Sat•chit•ananda is everything.

Existence•Consciousness•Bliss

Being•Knowing•Enjoying

Are we being, knowing, and enjoying ourselves? Or are we busy doing, ignoring, and suffering?

Are we interbeing or separating?

Consciousness defaults to ignorance. We can metastasize our ignorance with fear, or we can fill it and blast it away with love.

Life is not suffering. Denial is suffering. Rejection is painful. What we resist persists. Delusion hurts. Illusions confuse. Life is absurd.

There is nothing but satchitananda. This endless, beginningless, dimensionless, timeless, shapeless, uniform, mindless love dreaming.

Satchitananda differentiates into every absurd individual it can dream up. Each one shares its core qualities and abilities: the void of ignorance, the light of awareness, the drive to love, attention to direct, and intent to set. Consciousness manifests every set and setting it can imagine our lights of awareness to play within.
