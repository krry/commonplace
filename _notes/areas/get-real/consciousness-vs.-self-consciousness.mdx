title: Consciousness Vs. Self Consciousness
---
# Consciousness Vs. Self Consciousness- I'm seeing this duality more starkly than ever
    - {{table}}
        - [[Self-consciousness]]
            - [[CNXNS]]
        - Being terrified to be near each other
            - Wanting everyone to be well
        - Hiding our faces in shame
            - Smiling with our neighbors
        - Spouting and spraying vitriol behind a mask
            - Sharing sacred silence and space
