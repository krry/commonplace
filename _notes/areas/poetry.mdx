# Poetry

[[on-your-marks]], get set, go.
It seems that perhaps [[how-becoming]].
Oops, that's the deep end. ðŸ¤¿

Beware, I am an [[unlicensed-poet]].
What you are about to encounter
will question the integrity of your bowels for you.

Perhaps you will enjoy this [[untitled-piece]] of drooly drivel.

[[i-woke-up-today-hoping]] I could one day write a decent poem.
Until that day, until [[coyotes-run-these-streets]], we'll just [[let-the-wave-crash-over-us]].

Total shit like [[beltwar]]. I mean, what!?
There's one called [[wolftree-wagon]] that I almost surely didn't write.
More recently I've been [[ive-been-homeless-and-less]].

And in case you didn't hear [[ding-dong-the-dream-is-dead]].
Okay that one is quite a delight, but c'mon did I have to bring up vaccines?
Mask on, fuck it, mask offâ€¦

We gourmands of the heart and the nooks tend to take the [[shortest-path]] between [[i-like-yr-nope]] and [[f-it]].

There are pieces that no one would dare to read twice like [[rams-bumping-uglily]]
and hundreds more like it, literally hundreds, as charming as [[organ-eyes]].
