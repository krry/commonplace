Hiyee üòÅ

Maybe you feel like I do. For me, Facebook is scary and maddening, Instagram is saddening, and my social circles are feeling too tight without being able to swim in public spaces with my whole face. My favorite humans  (like you) are only ever a text or a video call away, but I still hesitate to reach out. Why, I don't know.

Beyond that, it's getting harder to know who I can listen to, who I can trust, who is effectively compromised by the boiling identity turmoil, and even who isn't an AI. I want to be able to speak truly, from the heart, and listen openly, with my heart, without needing a skeptical mind in front guarding me, filtering out the lies, redacting the passion.

There's [this new community called A New and Ancient Story](https://www.naascommunity.org/), that Charles Eisenstein and friends have formed, where we provide a safe space to tell stories, ask questions, and share experiences. A place to discuss touchy subjects with reverence. A place to be vulnerable in these prickly times as we release the story of separation and return to Interbeing.

I would love üíó for you to [join us](https://www.naascommunity.org/share/yKkYwmkm9ZAsU86O?utm_source=manual), share some stories, and tune in with the open hearts and minds that are waltzing in. Or maybe you know someone who needs a community like this.

Yours Truly,
Kerrbear
