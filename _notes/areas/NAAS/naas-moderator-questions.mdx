1. I wish to be of service to a broader, more global community. And I want to live in a world where every human is aware of our common ground. So I look for groups, communities, friends who either already see that we share everything, or who deeply need to see this. Joining this team might offer a mix of both.

2. This is realistic. I have plenty of free time.

3. In 2015, I drowned, died for several minutes, and revived. Crossing over and back again—this encounter with the infinite fundamental love that guides what is to evolve—instilled me with deep, lasting calm.

   Graduating high school in 2000 would make me a millennial, right? My childhood was offline, and my adulthood has been largely online. So I am fluent in the old ways and the new.

   Beyond this, I do not identify myself with race, ethnicity, occupation, sexual orientation, gender, or age, and I am devoted to encouraging others to define their own identity, or to refrain from identifying with form or function.

4. I was an IP attorney, have trained in negotiation and mediation, and ascribe to Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication methods.

5. Recently I find myself drawn to transformations in several realms that the NAAS community will approach. In ecology, efforts of rewilding and regardening are very exciting and encouraging. Socially, I am energized about moving from a culture of dominance to one of partnership, from androcracy to gylany, as Riane Eisler terms them. Economically, I'd love to see us return to the primal generosity that is our sacred nature. Regardless of the topic, I am interested in pointing toward harmony.

6. I struggle to see the value of dogma. Most systemic violence can be traced back to a stubbornly held belief or opinion, back to dogma. That said, I do not hold onto opinions even of this sort, lest they become dogma themselves.

   I won't struggle to put the good of the community before my own opinions. And I hope that participating in this community will help to shine light into blind spots of which I am not aware.

7. A community focused on fostering the transition from dominance to responsibility, from separation to interbeing, from slavery to sovereignty, necessarily must include those who are stuck in the old stories. Ideally, all human beings will join in this new understanding at the speed of thought. We must consider the signal-to-noise ratio in order to ensure that the message of peace is received intact. If the community becomes overwhelmed with trolls, it may fail to serve its purpose. If instead there is too little discord or not enough naysayers, it risks becoming a mutual admiration society, or merely another echo chamber. We'll have to surf the wave as it crashes behind us.

8. Once a big bumblebee landed on my hand. It moved slowly, looked a bit woozy. So I dripped some water near it, and it drank up a few drops. Then I offered it some of the apple I was eating, which it happily slurped on with its little proboscis. We sat for a bit and then the bee buzzed along.
