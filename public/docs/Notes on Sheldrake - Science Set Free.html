<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 99 &middot; Location 1671</div><div class='noteText'>Removing our short human life perspective from our model of nature allows the possibility that all aspects of nature, and of physical reality, are evolving toward profitability, or disarray.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 105 &middot; Location 1774</div><div class='noteText'>Creativity is a mystery precisely because it involves the appearance of patterns that have never existed before . Our usual way of explaining things is in terms of preexisting causes : the cause somehow contains the effect ; the effect follows from the cause . If we apply this way of thinking to the creation of a new form of life , a new work of art , or a new idea , we infer that the new pattern of organization was already present : it was a latent possibility . Given the appropriate circumstances , this latent pattern becomes actual . It is discovered rather than created . Creativity consists in the manifestation of eternally preexisting possibilities . In other words , the new pattern has not been created at all ; it has only been manifested in the physical world , whereas previously it was unmanifest .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 105 &middot; Location 1780</div><div class='noteText'>Campbell would explain that The Big Computer generates all future possibilities as we conscious beings make our choices. Our creativity draws from the domain of possibilities which exists outside our spacetime ruleset. Previously manifested forms may gain greater probability of actualization in future reality state vectors. Morphic resonance may seek to describe the underlying functions of TBC that calculate the probabilities of future manifestations.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 106 &middot; Location 1803</div><div class='noteText'>Nature is more and better than a plan in course of realisation . A plan is a term assigned to a labour : it closes the future whose form it indicates . Before the evolution of life , on the contrary , the portals of the future remain wide open . It is a creation that goes on for ever in virtue of an initial movement . This movement constitutes the unity of the organized world — a prolific unity , of an infinite richness , superior to any that the intellect could dream of , for the intellect is only one of its aspects or products . 58</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 107 &middot; Location 1807</div><div class='noteText'>The curiosity of Consciousness generates the wonders of evolution, even the intellect we use to observe and analyze its wonders.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 107 &middot; Location 1811</div><div class='noteText'>By contrast , a radically evolutionary view of nature implies an ongoing creativity , establishing new habits and regularities as nature evolves .

<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 109 &middot; Location 1836</div><div class='noteText'>The central doctrine of materialism is that matter is the only reality . Therefore consciousness ought not to exist . Materialism's biggest problem is that consciousness does exist . You are conscious now .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 111 &middot; Location 1870</div><div class='noteText'>The strongest argument in favor of materialism is the failure of dualism to explain how immaterial minds work and how they interact with brains . The strongest argument in favor of dualism is the implausibility and self - contradictory nature of materialism .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 114 &middot; Location 1925</div><div class='noteText'>Francis Crick admitted that the " astonishing hypothesis " was not proved . He conceded that a dualist view might become more plausible . But , he added , There is always a third possibility : that the facts support a new , alternative way of looking at the mind - brain problem that is significantly different from the rather crude materialistic view that many neuroscientists hold today and also from the religious point of view . Only time , and much further scientific work , will enable us to decide . 9 There is indeed a third way .</div>

<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 116 &middot; Location 1966</div><div class='noteText'>Conatus, striving, takes many forms, depending on a being's complexity of interaction. Evolution toward profitability via Campbell sounds in line with Spinoza's concept of conatus.</div>

<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 120 &middot; Location 2039</div><div class='noteText'>The fundamental units of nature , including photons and electrons , are temporal as well as spatial . There is no " nature at an instant . " 30</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 120 &middot; Location 2041</div><div class='noteText'>We have these qualia occurring within these quanta. They are tiny and nearly imperceptible, but they wholly form our experience of reality.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 121 &middot; Location 2045</div><div class='noteText'>By contrast , for Whitehead mind and matter are related as phases in a process . Time , not space , is the key to their relationship . Reality consists of moments in process , and one moment informs the next . The distinction between moments requires the experiencer to feel the difference between the moment of now and past or future moments . Every actuality is a moment of experience . As it expires and becomes a past moment , it is succeeded by a new moment of " now , " a new subject of experience . Meanwhile the moment that has just expired becomes a past object for the new subject — and an object for other subjects too . Whitehead summed this up in the phrase " Now subject , then object . " 31 Experience is always " now , " and matter is always " ago . " The link from the past to the present is physical causality , as in ordinary physics , and from the present to the past is feeling or , to use Whitehead's technical term , " prehension , " meaning , literally , seizing or grasping . According to Whitehead , every actual occasion is therefore both determined by physical causes from the past , and by the self - creative , self - renewing subject that both chooses its own past and chooses among its potential futures . Through its prehensions it selects what aspects of the past it brings into its own physical being in the present , and also chooses among the possibilities that determine its future . It is connected to its past by selective memories , and connected to its potential future through its choices .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 121 &middot; Location 2059</div><div class='noteText'>There is thus a time - polarity between the mental and physical poles of an event : physical causation from past to present , and mental causation from present to past .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 122 &middot; Location 2061</div><div class='noteText'>Feelings , emotions and experiences are more fundamental than human consciousness , and every mental event is informed and causally conditioned by material events , which are themselves composed of expired experiences .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 122 &middot; Location 2067</div><div class='noteText'>One of his modern exponents , Christian de Quincey , has described his idea as follows : Think of reality as made up of countless gazillions of " bubble moments , " where each bubble is both physical and mental — a bubble or quantum of sentient energy … Each bubble exists for a moment and then pops ! and the resulting " spray " is the objective " stuff " that composes the physical pole of the next momentary bubble … Time is our experience of the ongoing succession of these momentary bubbles of being ( or bubbles of becoming ) popping in and out of the present moment of now . We feel this succession of moments as the flow of the present slipping into the past , always replenished by new moments of " now " from an apparently inexhaustible source we objectify as the future … The future does not exist except as potentials or possibilities in the present moment — in experience — which is always conditioned by the objective pressure of the past ( the physical world ) . Subjectivity ( consciousness , awareness ) is what - it - feels - like to experience these possibilities , and choosing from them to create the next new moment of experience . 33</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 123 &middot; Location 2090</div><div class='noteText'>Second , Libet investigated what happened when people made free conscious choices . He measured the electrical activity of their brains by means of an electroencephalograph ( EEG ) , with small electrodes placed on the surface of the head . The subjects sat quietly , and were asked to flex one of their fingers or push a button whenever they felt like doing so . They also noted when they decided or felt the wish to do so . This conscious decision occurred about 200 milliseconds before the finger movement . This seems straightforward — the choice preceded the action . What was remarkable was that electrical changes began in the brain about 300 milliseconds before any conscious decision was made . 35 These changes were called the " readiness potential . "</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 124 &middot; Location 2102</div><div class='noteText'>The CMF acted on the activities of the brain , perhaps by influencing otherwise random or indeterminate events in the nerve cells .

Consider a mind, exploring causation from probable, desirable futures, back to present choices, then beyond them into past results of similar choices. The present choices exist as possibilities not yet manifested or actualized. Past results have a similar consistency: nonphysical, former possibilities that manifested as experiences due to intentions set and choices made. Unactualized past possibilities are as unreal as desired future possibilities. But the mind has no trouble accessing all of these from the subjective perspective of one's mind, so long as they bear importance to the well-being of the mind in question. The mind simply navigates the domain of possibilities, noticing those of greater importance or impact more readily and comprehensively. Why they must be resonant I am not sure.

Accordingly , this " I " — that is , the soul by which I am what I am — is entirely distinct from the body , and indeed is easier to know than the body , and would not fail to be whatever it is , even if the body did not exist .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 294 &middot; Location 4814</div><div class='noteText'>Thought experiments have played an important part in science , most notably when Albert Einstein imagined himself running alongside a wave of light . He realized that , from the point of view of a disembodied mind travelling at the speed of light , the light would appear to be stationary and no time would elapse . This imaginary disembodied experience preoccupied him for years ; he first began thinking about it in 1896 when he was sixteen , and it played a crucial role in the development of his theory of relativity . 7</div>

They wrote in the passive voice as if they were dispassionate , disembodied observers before whom events unfolded spontaneously .</div>

Phenomena that do not fit — anomalies — are routinely dismissed or explained away . Scientists are often dogmatic and prejudiced when confronted with evidence or ideas that go against their beliefs . They usually ignore what they do not want to deal with .</div>

Some sciences involve experiments . Others do not . An astronomer cannot manipulate a star to see how it responds , and a paleontologist cannot travel back in time to change the way sediments formed in the ocean aeons ago .

Shamanic knowledge aims at something that is a someone — another subject . The form of the other is the person .
