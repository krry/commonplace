<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 103</div><div class='noteText'>Among other things , I'd like to know where I am and how I got here . It would also be nice to know just what " I " really is !</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 110</div><div class='noteText'>So far , they haven't been successful , and even if they were , such a theory wouldn't account for everything that's known to exist in the universe , for the universe also contains the nonphysical realities we call awareness and consciousness .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 110</div><div class='noteText'>Even the most advanced physical theories of everything fail to account for dark matter and dark energy which are far too mysterious and under-understood to include in a theory at all. Physics can describe the behavior (at a maximum) of only 4% of the known matter and energy in the observable universe.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Location 118</div><div class='noteText'>what all realities share in common is that they exist .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Location 120</div><div class='noteText'>I present a unified model of reality that explains reality as the manifestation of a singular or unitary absolute existence which has consciousness as an attribute that's intrinsic to its nature .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Location 137</div><div class='noteText'>if we're to undertake the task of constructing a unified model of reality , we must begin with an assumption and an acceptance that the different pieces of reality we have to work with did at one time , in some way , exist in a state of undivided wholeness .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Location 173</div><div class='noteText'>Thus , existence becomes reality through a process of self - relation .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 204</div><div class='noteText'>" Reality is the result of a process whereby existence repetitively and progressively forms relationships with itself . "</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 204</div><div class='noteText'>The book summed up in a sentence.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 217</div><div class='noteText'>On the one hand , humanity's approach to understanding the tree of reality through science has generally been from above — i.e . , from a position of standing over rather than standing under — viewing and describing reality as seen through the leaves of experience and experiment .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 217</div><div class='noteText'>Perhaps, by ignoring the nature and preeminence of consciousness, Materialist Scientism has been developing our overstanding of reality rather than our understanding of it.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 257</div><div class='noteText'>consciousness doesn't somehow arise at some later stage in the evolution of existence , but rather that the evolution of existence into experience isn't other than the evolution of consciousness into awareness and that experiential reality itself is what's created at a certain stage in the evolution of consciousness - existence .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 259</div><div class='noteText'>In other words , what we'll show is that consciousness isn't a product of the machinations of physical reality but , on the contrary , that physical reality , as we experience it to exist , is itself a product of consciousness , albeit consciousness existing in relation to itself .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 338</div><div class='noteText'>Specifically , within the context of the relational - matrix model , we'll account for the following aspects of physical reality : ( 1 ) the relationship between space and time , including the basis of temporal relativity , as well as the precise nature of time as a function of the dynamic aspect of the spatial structure ; ( 2 ) the basis of the speed - of - light constant , including why the frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation are inversely related as a function of that constant ; ( 3 ) the basis of Planck's constant , including why the energy associated with electromagnetic radiation exists in discrete amounts , or quanta ; ( 4 ) the nature of gravitation , including why matter and gravitation are always associated and why gravitation is universally attractive ; ( 5 ) the equivalence of the gravitational and inertial forces ; ( 6 ) the relationship between electromagnetic radiation and gravitation ; ( 7 ) the nature of energy ; ( 8 ) wave / particle duality ; and ( 9 ) the uncertainty principle .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 344</div><div class='noteText'>Yes please! Explain ALL the physics!</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 358</div><div class='noteText'>Structure is relationship , or a set of relationships .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 379</div><div class='noteText'>Relative existence refers to existence that's what it is owing to the involvement of one aspect of existence in a relationship with some other aspect of existence .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 380</div><div class='noteText'>Hot is not hot without cold. Light is not light without dark. These exist only in relation or relative to each other.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 393</div><div class='noteText'>The structure of space is a relationship , the dynamic of energy is a relationship , the form of matter is a relationship , and the awareness of experience is a relationship .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 531</div><div class='noteText'>This paradox is unavoidable because absolute existence is everything and nothing , simultaneously . Absolute existence is the source of all relative existences , of all realities , of all somethings , and yet , as such , it's itself nonrelative , or no - thing .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 581</div><div class='noteText'>Figure 6 ( Left ) The fractal image known as the Mandelbrot set . ( Right ) An enlargement of an area of the image on the left . Fractals are finite , inasmuch as the interior border can be considered a sphere , or a closed loop . However , fractals also are seemingly infinite , in that upon closer inspection , that internal border reveals endless convolutions and patterns . These images show how patterns are repeated throughout different levels of the fractal structure . Such a repetition of pattern within pattern , of structure within structure , of form within form , occurs as the result of iterant processing . Reality itself evolves through an iterant , or repetitive and progressive , process ( i.e . , dualization or self - relation ) , causing patterns , structures , and forms to repeat themselves at different relational levels of existence . For example , organic cellular structure is a fractal repetition of the underlying cellular structure of reality itself .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 587</div><div class='noteText'>Fractal nature of reality well-explained</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 616</div><div class='noteText'>The structure of space - time can therefore be modeled in terms of relationships existence has formed with itself . Existence can form a relationship with itself by dualizing into a pair of complementary realities . Complementary realities are each opposite and mutually coexistent .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 660</div><div class='noteText'>The volumetric existence of a reality cell is simply a relative measure of reality - cell size that provides a means of quantifying the structural aspect , or spatial construct , of a reality cell .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 716</div><div class='noteText'>Note that , although the exchange of spatial content between reality cells is ongoing and dynamic , that same dynamic also supports the pattern of relational structure , or spatial construct , which is the stable set of relationships within the relational matrix . That is , although each reality cell is defined as continuously penetrating adjacent reality cells , since all the reality cells are doing the same thing , the net effect is the creation of a stable structure or spatial construct that has intrinsically dynamic content .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 720</div><div class='noteText'>Reality cells maintain a stable structure via continuous dynamic interpenetration, gyroscopic and fractal at once.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 732</div><div class='noteText'>Therefore , the period wherein a complete exchange of spatial content occurs between two reality cells we'll call the reality - cell period of content exchange ( POCE ) ,</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 772</div><div class='noteText'>The constancy of the rate of penetration allows us to mathematically define an inverse relationship between reality - cell VE and POCE . The VE is linked to the POCE through the rate - of - penetration constant ( kRP ) . Therefore , we can define the inverse relationship between reality - cell VE and POCE as VE = kRP / POCE or POCE = kRP / VE , or simply POCE × VE = kRP .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1373</div><div class='noteText'>In other words , what we observe as the expansion of the universe is one half of the dynamic involved in maintaining the relational state of existence that is the universe . The other half of that dynamic involves the universe as relational matrix , as finite bordered relative existence , being penetrated by whatever it is that it exists in relation to , which , again , in this case is infinite borderless absolute existence .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1394</div><div class='noteText'>In this way , the interplay or interrelation between structural constraint and unconstrained possibility creates a universe of infinite form and endless structural variation , wherein no snowflake is identical to another snowflake . This is finite structural existence embodied ( i.e . , taking shape ) within , and in relation to , infinite nonstructural existence . Look at a flower , and what you're seeing is the marriage of the infinite to the finite , the marriage of existence to itself , existing in relation to itself . Look at anything else , or look into a mirror , and you're observing the same .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1413</div><div class='noteText'>Space doesn't exist " within " the reality cell ; space is the reality cell , and the structure of space is derived from the relationships between reality cells .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1417</div><div class='noteText'>Essentially , time will be shown to be nothing more than a measure of the cyclic or periodic activity of compound distortion processes , or matter .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1484</div><div class='noteText'>The reality cells don't occur in a continuous gradient but in discrete sizes . Because each reality cell exists as a result of the dualization of a larger reality cell , this relationship creates " quantum jumps " between one reality - cell size and the next smaller or larger reality - cell size .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1802</div><div class='noteText'>Thus , it's not the gravitational distortion itself that's attractive ; rather , it's how the gravitational distortion is always radially distributed around electromagnetic radiation and matter that makes the gravitational distortion function as attractive .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1868</div><div class='noteText'>Interactive - process stability is defined as the interaction of two or more primary distortion processes in such a way that a stable repetitive pattern of interaction is formed .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1874</div><div class='noteText'>A compound process composed of just two interacting primary distortion processes we'll call a compound process of the first order . Compound processes of the first order represent the most basic form of matter .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1908</div><div class='noteText'>In the diagram at the bottom right , although they aren't depicted , the gravitational distortions are what's responsible for interactive - process stability , because they act to " knot " the electromagnetic components together , with each distortion process binding the others into a pattern of distortion propagation that's simultaneously binding upon itself , thereby creating a pattern integrity , a self - sustaining , self - perpetuating pattern of distortion propagation , defined as a compound distortion process .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1927</div><div class='noteText'>Matter is a dynamic structure , composed of the stable repetitive interaction of two or more primary distortion processes ( i.e . , two or more EMR - gravitation complexes ) . Matter represents the third stage of existential self - relation , or the third way in which existence is able to form relationships with itself .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2005</div><div class='noteText'>this way , existence continues to evolve into more elaborate structures through a process of repetitive and progressive self - relation , with each level of structure and relationship providing the raw material for the next .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2013</div><div class='noteText'>In this way , EMR - gravitation complexes interact to form subatomic or quantum particles , subatomic particles interact to form atoms , atoms interact to form molecules , and molecules interact to form complex material structures and organisms .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2027</div><div class='noteText'>because primary distortion processes must propagate nonlinearly in order to stably and repetitively interact , they then appear individually to propagate at less than the speed of light , and the compound process as a whole also must propagate at less than the speed of light .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2041</div><div class='noteText'>The compound processes depicted in this diagram travel only one - half the linear distance that the linearly propagating pdp's do within the same number of POCEs . Since the linear propagation of the pdp's occurs at the speed of light , the propagation of the compound processes is occurring at one - half the speed of light .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 2043</div><div class='noteText'>Compound processes seem to travel more slowly than linear primary distortion processes because the component wavicles travel in a spiral not a straight line.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2078</div><div class='noteText'>material velocity is purely a function of the interactive structure of the component processes that make up matter .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2135</div><div class='noteText'>It's in this way and for this reason that matter becomes associated with a surrounding gravitational field whose strength ( i.e . , attractiveness ) increases as the number of primary distortion processes composing the matter increases .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 2137</div><div class='noteText'>gravity increases with mass</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2154</div><div class='noteText'>Since the gravitational - distortion content always increases in the direction of the matter from which it radiates , the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic components of a primary distortion process is always altered in the direction of that matter , causing the gravitational distortion , which always exists in a gradient , to function as an attractive force on both energy processes and material objects .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2164</div><div class='noteText'>One of the most interesting things about gravitational acceleration is that all material objects , regardless of their weight , size , or shape , accelerate at the same rate when they encounter the same gravitational field .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2209</div><div class='noteText'>The component processes always propagate at the speed of light . However , interacting to form a CP , they propagate nonlinearly . The velocity of the CP as a whole is determined by the degree of linearity of propagation of the component processes . As the degree of linearity of propagation of the component processes increases , the velocity of the CP as a whole also increases .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2217</div><div class='noteText'>The equivalence of material acceleration with regard to the same gravitational field acting upon different material objects occurs because gravitation isn't acting upon the matter as a whole , at a level where there exists some structural difference . Rather , gravitation is acting at the level of the individual fundamental constituents of matter , at the level of the primary distortion processes , at the level of the EMR - gravitation complex , where there's no structural difference — i.e . , where there's structural equivalence .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2234</div><div class='noteText'>That is , the consistent radial distribution of the gravitational distortion around matter , through its consistent effect upon the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic components of primary distortion processes , causes space to function as if it were curved in the area of a gravitational field , and thus creates the appearance that gravitation causes an actual bending or curvature of the spatial structure .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2243</div><div class='noteText'>gravitation causes space to function as if it were curved , relative to areas of space that don't contain a strong gravitational field , but gravitation doesn't actually curve or bend the spatial structure .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2347</div><div class='noteText'>We wouldn't say , " I'm going to measure an inch , " because we know that the inch is only the measurement , and what we're measuring is spatial distance .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 2348</div><div class='noteText'>We would say we are measuring length though, which is a dimensional measure of spatial distance. Perhaps time is a dimensional measure of content exchange among reality cells.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2379</div><div class='noteText'>Therefore , when material velocity is altered , material dynamic or periodicity is also altered , and so time , as a measure of material dynamic or periodicity , is also altered . This interdependence of material structure and dynamic is the basis of both temporal and mass relativity .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2442</div><div class='noteText'>Referring back to figures 47 and 49 , we can see that for an individual compound process , as the degree of linearity of propagation of the component processes increases , the compound process as a whole travels through the relational matrix at a higher velocity , and also undergoes relatively fewer compound process periods , than if it were traveling at a lower velocity ( i.e . , with less linearity of component process propagation ) through the relational matrix .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 2445</div><div class='noteText'>As matter travels faster, it undergoes fewer cycles of dynamic content exchange per unit of spatial distance, meaning time passes more slowly. Faster motion leaves less possibility of tiny, fundamental changes in matter as it propagates through space.</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2479</div><div class='noteText'>Space doesn't have a fourth dimension that's time ; rather , three - dimensional space has an intrinsic dynamic aspect . That intrinsic and invariant dynamic aspect drives the varying dynamic or periodicity of the compound processes which exist as extensions of the dynamic structure of space . Time is simply the way in which that varying dynamic or periodicity manifests materially and so becomes measurable .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2942</div><div class='noteText'>Concepts associated with quantum theory , such as nonlocality , point toward an underlying level of reality wherein what we experience as the separate material objects of physical reality are really inseparable and so must be connected or interconnected . In addition , the concept of wave / particle duality associated with quantum theory points toward a level of reality at which the experiencer is inseparable from what's experienced as reality .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2954</div><div class='noteText'>This theoretical nonlocal effect was experimentally demonstrated in what are called the Aspect experiments , after the French quantum physicist Alain Aspect .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2982</div><div class='noteText'>For example , we could ask , which came first , the chicken or the egg ? The form of this question implies a linear cause - and - effect relationship between the chicken and the egg , and the question seeks to find the order of that relationship . The question in this form has no valid answer , because the relationship of chicken and egg isn't actually linear , or cause and effect ; rather , it's cyclic , or relational . The chicken comes from the egg , and the egg comes from the chicken .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3051</div><div class='noteText'>The crux of the matter is that physical reality — the reality which we hold so dear , the reality which to us seems the realest and which for us defines what " real " is — actually has the least degree of reality . Physical reality is real , it does exist , but as an experiential reality it doesn't exist at the undivided differentiated level of reality that functions as the foundation of the experiential level of reality .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3100</div><div class='noteText'>" To meet the challenge before us , our notions of cosmology and of the general nature of reality must have room in them to permit a consistent account of consciousness . Vice versa , our notions of consciousness must have room in them to understand what it means for its content to be ‘ reality as a whole . ' The two sets of notions together should then be such as to allow for an understanding as to how consciousness and reality are related . " — David Bohm , from the introduction to Wholeness and the Implicate Order34</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3165</div><div class='noteText'>When the Michelson - Morley experiment disproved the existence of an ether , Einstein was moved to postulate an absolute and invariant speed of light . 35 This postulated invariant speed of light , however , created another contradiction regarding moving frames of reference , which Einstein was able to resolve only by concluding that time couldn't be absolutely defined</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3205</div><div class='noteText'>So , Werner Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics to deal with the particle characteristics , and eventually matrix mechanics was combined with wave mechanics to create what we now call quantum mechanics .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3215</div><div class='noteText'>Along with wave / particle duality came Heisenberg's uncertainty or indeterminacy principle , which mathematically demonstrated the impossibility of measuring both the position and the momentum of a subatomic particle simultaneously , thus precluding the possibility of defining with certainty the total state of any quantum system .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3244</div><div class='noteText'>However , with the discovery of wave / particle duality , not only did we need to be present to see what was being revealed , but our presence itself was partly responsible for what we saw .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3307</div><div class='noteText'>This first view sees the universe existing as a machination in a box , where definite parts exist in the box , but whenever we open the box to look at the parts , our action of opening the box disturbs the parts in such a way that we can never see all the parts at once or never see them as they are when the box is closed , and so we can't determine the actual state of what's in the box in the absence of observation .</div>

<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3334</div><div class='noteText'>In this second view , if the universe is like a box we want to look into , we assume that there exists in the box no - thing definable apart from any - thing else . In this view , looking into the box doesn't disturb what's in the box , doesn't change what's in the box ; rather , the act of looking into the box itself creates what's seen as the defined reality existing within the box . Open the box from this side and look in , and you create this experiential reality ; open the box from that side and look in , and you create that experiential reality . Until the box is opened , there's actually no - thing in it .</div>

<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3348</div><div class='noteText'>To use David Bohm's terminology , looking into the box relevates or explicates an experiential reality from the implicate unexperienced reality .

In this view , unexperienced reality is regarded as intrinsically undefined and indeterminate , not existing in any definite state , with no determinate characteristics , unless and until it's observed .
