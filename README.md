# The Commonplace of Kerrbear

My humble commonplace "book" which:

- is effectively a digital garden
- uses the Zettelkasten method
- started as an archive of markdown writings and a [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) graph
- templated on @yenly's [Foamy NextJS](https://github.com/yenly/foamy-nextjs) starter
- sails the open-source, data-sovereign seas with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io)
- can also be maintained with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- is auto-published with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) whenever I **_Ship It!_**â„¢
- that lives at [kerrbear.wtf](https://kerrbear.wtf)
